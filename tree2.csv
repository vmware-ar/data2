411,Dennis Smith,Tanzu,they want to make openshift to be the next linux the operating system across all environments not distinguishing the operating system from kubernetes  they view them as the same thing so k8s is the operating system for the hybrid environment which if it takes is a powerful narrative,5/20/2020,Advice,Competitive mentions/intel,2020.2,FY21 Q2

1028,Dennis Smith,All Products,companies that came out of 911 best had something going on where vendors that gave free things assistance to strategic customers planting oaktrees vs flowers not focusing on the quarter but partnering for the longterm when things like this happen customers look to enterprises for help not startups capacity planning for infrastructure,3/26/2020,Neutral,Strategy,2020.1,FY21 Q1

1104,Dennis Smith,Management (vRealize),the lines look blurred between vrops and wavefront,3/17/2020,Neutral,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2020.1,FY21 Q1
1116,Dennis Smith,Management (vRealize),there is a time schedule each year for an mq  in many ways ive received less positive feedback from vendors than enterprises regarding the mq  the market is changing so quickly  it would have been better to do later in the year and as a market guide  its a nuanced environment  vendors are evolving and criteria are evolving different vendors are attacking from different areas  as we move forward its hard to do an apples to apples comparison,3/16/2020,Advice,Strategy,2020.1,FY21 Q1
1117,Dennis Smith,Management (vRealize),there is too much tool sprawl in the cmp market  an mq in the space adds to tool sprawl,3/16/2020,Advice,Strategy,2020.1,FY21 Q1
1118,Dennis Smith,Management (vRealize),containers are a big item,3/16/2020,Advice,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2020.1,FY21 Q1
1119,Dennis Smith,Management (vRealize),cloudhealth is the short stop and center fielder  most important item is governance  look for what cloudhealth is missing and building around it in a nice consumable way,3/16/2020,Advice,Strategy,2020.1,FY21 Q1
1120,Dennis Smith,Management (vRealize),vmware has a bunch of products in different stages of transition  tanzu is an interesting item he would like more details on how the rest of the portfolio fits with it,3/16/2020,Advice,Strategy,2020.1,FY21 Q1
1121,Dennis Smith,Management (vRealize),none of the vendors nailed governance in the mq  companies need to view across many different aspects  there is no unified data source and providing governance across with guardrails and structure  knowing where products fit in would be worthwhile,3/16/2020,Advice,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2020.1,FY21 Q1
1122,Dennis Smith,Management (vRealize),it really boils down to how do you pull the solutions together in a consumable way,3/16/2020,Advice,Strategy,2020.1,FY21 Q1
1123,Dennis Smith,Management (vRealize),customers are looking outside of vmware  many customers are having challenges  they site product confusion tough to get up and running and conflicting messages  in some ways its getting better but smaller players are addressing your weakness and swooping in with a unified offering  clarity is a key element,3/16/2020,Negative,Messaging,2020.1,FY21 Q1
1124,Dennis Smith,Management (vRealize),its become a very competitive market selling a license and how happy customers might be are two different things,3/16/2020,Advice,Strategy,2020.1,FY21 Q1
1125,Dennis Smith,Management (vRealize),tremendously bullish on tanzu offerings one could imagine that cloudhealth could plugin  or security or cas offerings  there is a danger of not orphaning users and including with simplification  id like a full picture of how these pieces play together,3/16/2020,Advice,Strategy,2020.1,FY21 Q1
1126,Dennis Smith,Management (vRealize),its about simplicity of product  how does it all for together and work with tanzu  what are the interfaces and what tool to use  it becomes a clarity question,3/16/2020,Advice,Strategy,2020.1,FY21 Q1
1323,Dennis Smith,vSphere 7 with K8s,the concept of an app is going to change kudos for you for pointing this out it also means there will be more applicationssystems as we are going forward you can connect those in infinite combinations curious as we go further as to what this means from a vmware perspective,2/21/2020,Positive,Messaging,2020.1,FY21 Q1
1324,Dennis Smith,vSphere 7 with K8s,make it explicit about how the two pieces tanzu and vsphere with kubernetes come together organizations are viewing these together companies that get it have their eye on both of those and want to understand both product sets dont come in as separate teams,2/21/2020,Advice,Messaging,2020.1,FY21 Q1
1325,Dennis Smith,vSphere 7 with K8s,your vsphere 7 with kubernetes messaging is good it highlights some of want you originally presented related to project pacific i think this is good,2/21/2020,Positive,Messaging,2020.1,FY21 Q1
1326,Dennis Smith,vSphere 7 with K8s,he is skeptical that vsphere is a viable edge solution if i have a donut shop with 1000 locationsi dont see using vsphere at the edge as viable longterm theres a heaviness there that i dont see will really play as you get into this containerbased kubernetes area,2/21/2020,Negative,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2020.1,FY21 Q1
1358,Dennis Smith,Edge,you dont have much of an edge solution if you present it to me and i have on my enterprise hat rancher has it but you dont no one wants a heavy flavor of pks at the edge,2/12/2020,Negative,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2020.1,FY21 Q1
1362,Dennis Smith,Serverless,he wondered if pfs is dead as he has not heard about it in a while wondered if it is dead told him it is still in play but he asks about it frequently,2/12/2020,Negative,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2020.1,FY21 Q1
1363,Dennis Smith,Tanzu,i loved the tanzu messaging framework i loved one slide im putting it on my door modern infrastructure up and  modern apps down you can now give a serious credible argument to the app developers important to keep that in mind as your guiding light will be key here that distinguishes what you offer and distinguishes you from a competitor like rancher or openshift i dont even know if they go as high to the app dev as pivotal and certainly dont go as low as you do in the infrastructure,2/12/2020,Positive,Messaging,2020.1,FY21 Q1
1364,Dennis Smith,Tanzu,this is good i hope youre half as excited about it as i am if you are then i think youll be successful here it looks good and im dying to see the actual feedback that you get on it,2/12/2020,Positive,Messaging,2020.1,FY21 Q1
1365,Dennis Smith,Tanzu,watch bringing the traditional pivotal clients this is newer stuff question many will have how much is powerpointrebranding vs actually new need to talk about what is out there and being used so folks know this isnt just some rebranding of existing stuff,2/12/2020,Advice,Messaging,2020.1,FY21 Q1
1366,Dennis Smith,Tanzu,good stuff folks im looking forward to it really i really am were getting into a couple of interesting quarters here around this domain to see how things pan out its a jump ball now with all the different vendors looking at coming at this in different ways,2/12/2020,Positive,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2020.1,FY21 Q1
1367,Dennis Smith,Tanzu Application Catalog,tanzu application catalogue is huge be sure to stress it enough it gives you a different type of credibility and frankly even a different audience than pivotal bitnami is more of an open developer type of environment,2/12/2020,Positive,Messaging,2020.1,FY21 Q1
1372,Dennis Smith,vSphere 7 with K8s,if you win 20 of your client base thats huge no need to get too crazy with your messaging you have a lot of home games homecoming games actually theyre easy to win you dont want to get too crazy and leave your key customer base,2/12/2020,Advice,Messaging,2020.1,FY21 Q1
1444,Dennis Smith,CloudHealth,cloudhealth receives high marks from its customers needing cost management and workload optimization,1/30/2020,Positive,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2019.4,FY20 Q4
1445,Dennis Smith,CloudHealth,normalizing the code base for onpremises and saas offerings,1/30/2020,Positive,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2019.4,FY20 Q4
1446,Dennis Smith,CloudHealth,strong financial position and presence in related markets,1/30/2020,Positive,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2019.4,FY20 Q4
1447,Dennis Smith,CloudHealth,vmwares offering is well suited to organizations focused on managing cloud costs,1/30/2020,Neutral,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2019.4,FY20 Q4
1448,Dennis Smith,CloudHealth,the entire landscape is rapidly shifting  we would argue that no market is under more pressure from competing vendors eg cloud providers msps more single focused vendors and large vendors that are acquiring and combining assets and rapidly changing requirements  so vision for most all vendors in the mq has changed year,1/30/2020,Advice,Strategy,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1449,Dennis Smith,CloudHealth,all due respect but it is actually a long list of products some legacy that you are reengineering many from acquired companies with different architectures data stores engineering teams etc  it makes it very difficult for an enterprise to blend their strategy with such a large pool of different offerings,1/30/2020,Advice,Strategy,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1450,Dennis Smith,CloudHealth,i struggle in finding consistency with that and how your product set is playing out around that  for example if i target just one function eg cost management for my hybrid deployment ie onpremises and say azure i probably needwant two vmware products vrealize operations and cloudhealth which are minimally integrated tools with separate identity management data models and user interfaces  that complexity increases if i need to handle other functions with more products with different user interfaces data models etc,1/30/2020,Advice,Strategy,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1451,Dennis Smith,CloudHealth,cloudhealth is a fantastic product that has had great success but it is primarily a cost optimization tool not a cmp as we have defined it,1/30/2020,Advice,Strategy,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1452,Dennis Smith,CloudHealth,too many products to satisfy the cloud management functionality that most vendors solve with a single unified offering,1/30/2020,Negative,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2019.4,FY20 Q4
1453,Dennis Smith,CloudHealth,lagging versus the competition among the items missing are request approval workflows and catalog item spending limits,1/30/2020,Negative,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2019.4,FY20 Q4
1454,Dennis Smith,CloudHealth,difficult for vmware to continually rationalize product and coordinate with the many different internal development teamsthis is 3 times the number for the other vendors,1/30/2020,Negative,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2019.4,FY20 Q4
1457,Dennis Smith,Tanzu Observability,we are not seeing tremendous traction with these wavefront and vra offerings particularly not as standalone products that are winning bakeoffs  in fact in many ways we see your field teams struggling with how to market and sale your many offerings  in some ways that is not surprising with the many offerings,1/30/2020,Advice,Strategy,2019.4,FY20 Q4
2049,Dennis Smith,Pivotal,has not seen anything about pivotal functions service recently was told there will be more discussion following the acquisition,11/13/2019,Neutral,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2019.4,FY20 Q4
2139,Dennis Smith,Management (vRealize),your roadmap doesnt make sense to me for only sddc in the shorter term  the roadmap should include wavefront,10/28/2019,Advice,Strategy,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2278,Dennis Smith,All Products,vmware has made lots of acquisitions   need to communicate where are they now six months 12 months 23 years  need to show where things are going and how they fit into overall vision not clear that vmware understands the bigger picture  just has a bunch of piece parts  put everything in context,10/7/2019,Negative,Strategy,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2279,Dennis Smith,All Products,vmware gaps vmc on x   need it to be a pass through or truck stop  give customers ability to operationalize run other items on the stack  vmware is the defacto arms dealer  perception that these guys are just buying companies  dont have a strategy ,10/7/2019,Advice,Strategy,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2285,Dennis Smith,Containers/PKS,marry cloud management and kubernetes  go together  lifecycle management lots of players in that place  rancher labs is a niche player but shows up a lot  they dont have enough density to cover all of the activity and advance it,10/7/2019,Advice,Strategy,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2299,Dennis Smith,Pivotal,agrees with pivotal reacquisition  timing is right   enterprises asking the right questions about how containers fit into the overall picture it is a lot for customers to understand,10/7/2019,Positive,Strategy,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2300,Dennis Smith,Pivotal,customers are very loyal to pivotal  their arrogance has stopped them from getting into some deals,10/7/2019,Neutral,Strategy,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2301,Dennis Smith,Pivotal,dennis is watching for inconsistency or deviations from what pat said at vmworld vs what actually happens with pivotall once acquired,10/7/2019,Neutral,Strategy,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2302,Dennis Smith,Pivotal,pivotal strategy is similar to ibm redhat  acquisition has been getting weird  overlap in messaging  red hat views ibm as a partner  like a married couple living in different sides of a duplex,10/7/2019,Negative,Competitive mentions/intel,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2303,Dennis Smith,Pivotal,dennis has been close to pivotal  positive on their technology chops  arrogance has slowed them down but vmware will help,10/7/2019,Positive,Messaging,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2304,Dennis Smith,Pivotal,vmware should be touting hybrid cloud theme  pivotal needs boots on the ground they build ferrari  not a ford  ,10/7/2019,Advice,Messaging,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2305,Dennis Smith,Pivotal,leveraging all vmware tools is good with operational activitiesprovision once run and managechallenge pivotal on this all the time  they need to take head on argument on other side not innovating or slowing them down  pivotal   not convinced they are pedestrian  if compare what offer vs aws they are similar  leverage bitnami and pull together ecosystem around choice and multicloud is the narrative that vmware needs to push  it is about choice  that would resonate with large enterprises  ,10/7/2019,Advice,Strategy,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2657,Dennis Smith,Pivotal,pivotal  positive  gives vmware a narrative against ibmred hat,8/22/2019,Positive,Messaging,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2658,Dennis Smith,Pivotal,pivotal   hybrid multicloud narrative is key,8/22/2019,Neutral,Messaging,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2659,Dennis Smith,Pivotal,been saying for 5 years that vmware should bring pivotal back into the fold,8/22/2019,Positive,Strategy,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2660,Dennis Smith,Pivotal,does this concede that maybe it was a mistake to spin pivotal off in 2013 or is it a matter of the timing being right now with kubernetes and such bringing them back into the fold,8/22/2019,Neutral,Strategy,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2661,Dennis Smith,Pivotal,clearly the whole hybrid multicloud narrative is really key the importance and the underlying infrastructure i was preannounced on project pacific in my eyes i think its its a positive it gives you a narrative answer to the whole ibmred hat thing also which is a similar narrative coming at it a bit bit differently perhaps in all candidness im laughing because ive been saying for five years that you should buy pivotal back so its its good to hear that its finally coming down,8/22/2019,Neutral,Messaging,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2811,Dennis Smith,Containers/PKS,everyone is head long there run were having many messaging meetings etc the layer above it build i dont think the masses at vmware and pivotal understand what you have with bitnami and pivotal they can help you appeal to developers and take you above the fray of this shark tank of everyone trying to provide this kubernetes dialtone its much more than that handling the app developers and providing them services this is not just kubernetes this is really a platform that would allow me as a developer to transform my environment,7/31/2019,Advice,Strategy,2019.2,FY20 Q2
2812,Dennis Smith,Containers/PKS,there are a ton of competitors jumping in relatively large companies in the run piece almost an equal number running into the manage piece even though there are a lot of oneoff players too that build piece in many ways in my eyes is probably 5 layers you guys redhatibm aws azure and also google those are really the players here and frankly you and redhat and ibm are coming at this a little bit differently where youre saying we can provide those boxes and we can provide them anywhere as opposed to the other three buys,7/31/2019,Neutral,Competitive mentions/intel,2019.2,FY20 Q2

3092,Dennis Smith,Containers/PKS,asked if he sees people deploying kubernetes on existing hardware or they go out and buy new most of what he sees is in vmware environments if there is a transformation going on on the  infrastructure side those two shifts seem to be separate may not be tethered to an infrastructure refresh lots of companies refreshing leveraging that tax rebate in many cases those decisions are separate different budgets different parts of the organization,6/10/2019,Neutral,Adoption,2019.2,FY20 Q2
3096,Dennis Smith,Management (vRealize),pricing can be effective against redhat if youre looking at the cloud angle it becomes a little murkier that argument is more about abstracting complexity  preventing lockin can be competitive not sure the impact of your pricing will be the same in the cloud as vs redhat,6/10/2019,Neutral,Pricing,2019.2,FY20 Q2
3097,Dennis Smith,SDDC (vSphere),initially thought our proposed wcp pricing may be a bit high pointed out that open shift pricing is doggone high but that is due to so much functionality after he understood more about what is included in our proposed solution heptio distro of kubernetes some pieces of nsx he felt it was more in line with the openshift engine not openshift platform,6/10/2019,Advice,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2019.2,FY20 Q2

3099,Dennis Smith,SDDC (vSphere),mike pointed out that we will offer vsphere plus the new capability around the workload platform our heptio distro and some of nsx for a rounded out platform not just vsphere with a new capability when asked if customers would find this valuable dennis said that integration is huge and a pain many orgs wrestling with this vmware also has to be flexible and cant just bundle kubernetes with nsx and vsan meaning have to be integrated have to offer both of those the enterprise flavor as well as essentials ent  ess pks,6/10/2019,Advice,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2019.2,FY20 Q2
3100,Dennis Smith,SDDC (vSphere),in terms of pricing for wcp open shifts achilles heel is pricing better to be somewhat low than high because they are the one to beat you could upset the apple cart with this with the pricing if we go too high,6/10/2019,Advice,Competitive mentions/intel,2019.2,FY20 Q2
