1,Anne Thomas,Tanzu App Service,difficult to suggest new customers invest in current version of tas running on bosh bc of the transition to tas on kubernetes if they are existing customers who have been using it then its an easy yes the new customer value propisiton is more difficult to articulate ,6/29/2020,Negative,Customer Related,2020.2,FY21 Q2
2,Anne Thomas,Tanzu Kubernetes Grid,anne highlighted major concern among pks customers and confusion about pks and tkgtkgi she is looking for substantive content to help clarify confusion around this and pointed out that there is no tkgi content from the main vmwareare navigation page we get a redirect to tkg page off tanzuvmwarecom and there is nothing specific to tkgi there ,6/4/2020,Negative,Messaging,2020.2,FY21 Q2
3,Anne Thomas,Tanzu,anne also suggested that we need to make a definitive statement about lts and the future of tas and tas4kubernetes customers are asking if they should be abandoning classic pastas and if they should start working w k8s etc while we appreciate this is not a quick answer our relative silence is fueling confusion among customers and fomenting fud which our competitors are happy to capitalizing on ,6/4/2020,Advice,Support,2020.2,FY21 Q2
4,Jeffrey Hammond,Tanzu Data Services,it feels to me two options of orgs moving to modernize data layer vms on cloud and still manage themselves if they have the right data services they should have a managed service feel,6/17/2020,Neutral,Messaging,2020.2,FY21 Q2
5,Dave Bartoletti,Tanzu,red hats strategy for its isvs is to try to drag every isv it can to run on openshift the red hat strategy implications for csps red hat wants kubernetes to be a feature of the hypervisor  ,6/11/2020,Advice,Strategy,2020.2,FY21 Q2
6,Dave Bartoletti,Tanzu,isv dependencies to consider hard to take that dependency with the platform dave tells customers to first get it on aws or wait to do hybrid cloud but aws bc youll get to market faster ,6/11/2020,Neutral,Strategy,2020.2,FY21 Q2
7,Dave Bartoletti,Tanzu,isvs addressable market keeps expanding bc we are expanding the ways their customers can run their softwareim so glad you are thinking about this now vmwareare has tight relationships w isv you can expand their addressable market and we can make this additive w containers ,6/11/2020,Positive,Strategy,2020.2,FY21 Q2
8,Dave Bartoletti,Tanzu,three challenges for isvs will it make me stand out if i rearchitect my application to be microservices  can i tell that its better bc of it can i go to ops teams saying its easier to run on a bunch of clusters are people gonna buy it and manage it themselves or consume it as a service look at liberty mutual aws use case ,6/11/2020,Advice,Strategy,2020.2,FY21 Q2
9,Anne Thomas,Tanzu Data Services,you will have more of an opportunity of the data services run on vanilla kubernetes,6/3/2020,Advice,Messaging,2020.2,FY21 Q2
10,Anne Thomas,Tanzu Data Services,there is an obvious using tas or tas4kubernetes and there is a lot of value in using these models integrated with that platform the more deep integration you can provide w platform the more valuable to customers ,6/3/2020,Positive,Messaging,2020.2,FY21 Q2
11,Bill Martorelli,Pivotal Labs/Services,from the buyers i know the awareness is limited in the distinction between architecture modernization and source code modernization but it is growing it influences our research the app and the infrastructure teams are still separage but converging,6/15/2020,Neutral,Customer Related,2020.2,FY21 Q2
12,Bill Martorelli,Pivotal Labs/Services,the system integrators are working with customers for app modernization services with customer app leaders they are not approaching or working their modernization services with the it operations side unless the customer is requesting it,6/15/2020,Neutral,Partner readiness,2020.2,FY21 Q2
13,James Governor,Pivotal Labs/Services,you should think about turning the labs transformation service into a digital experience that is your challenge which is an amazing one clearly  the red hat transformation office is talking a lot about automation and it seems more of an online experience you have got business as usual for a pivotal labs but if you find ways to scale what you do many orgs will be happy about that pivotal labs could be about distributed work and distributed training,6/6/2020,Negative,Pricing/packaging,2020.2,FY21 Q2
14,James Governor,Pivotal Labs/Services,if i was you i would want the freedom to say overall that pivotal labs is about writing better software no matter what language you use,6/6/2020,Advice,Messaging,2020.2,FY21 Q2
15,Rich Lane,Tanzu Observability,with microservices you dont need application performance monitoring apm apm vendors are in a panic because you dont need apm with microservices which is on the rise with modernizing applications observability is far more relevant,6/16/2020,Positive,Messaging,2020.2,FY21 Q2
16,Gregor Petri,VMC on X,on the previous slide you showed the difference between the two approaches why the different approach the first one vmwareare cloud on aws seems to work so why would you take a different approach for the second vmware cloud on other public clouds,6/2/2020,Neutral,Strategy,2020.2,FY21 Q2
17,Milind Govekar,VMC on X,if i say okay vmwareare has made a lot of investment in vmc on aws and they should actually manage a lot of that capability as time progresses maybe investment in azure and google cloud could match the one that youve done on aws do the partners then think that slowly depending on how lucrative google or azure becomes vmware will start controlling and managing everything and well be pushed out to some of the others is there any fear on that part or are you saying that youll never go to the other hyperscaler well just go on aws,6/2/2020,Neutral,Strategy,2020.2,FY21 Q2
18,Milind Govekar,Cloud (VCPP),i think this was very useful it gives a good idea of what you are planning with the partners,6/2/2020,Neutral,Partnerships,2020.2,FY21 Q2
19,Angelina Troy,VMC on AWS,one of the overiding things i see in terms of where interest lies is who their strategy provider is it seems to be reason number one when it comes to making these kinds of choices or at least where they start making these choices,6/2/2020,Neutral,Partnerships,2020.2,FY21 Q2
20,Angelina Troy,VMC on X,its probably 5050 of whether or not i take a call on vmwareare in the cloud that the client read the report on the comparison vmware clouds research note half of the time it spawns the discussion from i read this now i want to know the context for what im doing half of the time its like i just wanted to talk about this i didnt realize there was a document thats typical people are pretty happy with it the report its gotten a good reception good rating i think that it seems to have landed well its already out of date so ill have to update that early next year or after all of these things hit ga,6/2/2020,Neutral,Marketing Awareness,2020.2,FY21 Q2
21,Angelina Troy,Outpost (VMC on AWS),im not getting any aws outposts inquiry calls its kind of weird we dont have a lot of visibility why that is however when i look back at my azure stack inquiries i did take a bunch leading up to it and then there was a bit of a lull the pipeline ramped up and they got their sales engine going there was a constant trickle for azure stack inquiries maybe it will be the same way for aws outposts,6/2/2020,Neutral,Competitive mentions/intel,2020.2,FY21 Q2
22,Dennis Smith,Cloud (VCPP),are you looking to add other services within your hub things like some of the tanzu offerings or wavefront this appears to be more traditional spinning up of vms in the environment are you adding any upper layer services for these providers yes without a doubt ,6/3/2020,Neutral,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2020.2,FY21 Q2
23,Sid Nag,Cloud (VCPP),i think this vmwareare cloud partner hub is very powerful the reason its very powerful is because if what you said is true this completes the solution from lighthouse from azure the dependency of lighthouse is that the primary estate has to be azure in this case the estates are peer estates so this is a much more elegant solution than lighthouse,6/3/2020,Positive,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2020.2,FY21 Q2
24,Mike Dorosh,Cloud (VCPP),yeah this is absolutely a lot more elegant solution than lighthouse it puts the power in the partner the managed service providers hands to decide what and how vs lighthouse it opens up markets for your partner community and more importantly it opens up opportunities for vmwareare to play across all of these clouds a lot better,6/3/2020,Positive,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2020.2,FY21 Q2
25,Mike Dorosh,Cloud (VCPP),i will say that it gets a lot more interesting as you add more and more stuff to this thinking about your vcpp partners and some of the more advanced users of some of these things sooner or later they are going to want a onestop shop hub for this stuff they arent going to want to go to 23 different things or have to integrate 23 different things onto their workflows they are going to want consistency reporting pricing etc,6/3/2020,Positive,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2020.2,FY21 Q2
26,Mike Dorosh,Cloud (VCPP),you guys are going to have to think about positioning against lighthouse and arc with this program we are already getting questions around im a service provider that plays in the azure ecosystem and in the vmwareare ecosystem whose tools do i play with lighthouse and anthos even though thats more of a boogeyman right now than it is a reality,6/3/2020,Advice,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2020.2,FY21 Q2
27,Sid Nag,Cloud (VCPP),yes anthos to some degree the difference between anthos and lighthouse is that anthos is more arcish whereas lighthouse is more like this lighthouse and this have an msp angle to it but those are more selfprovisioning runitself managed tools tools dont make a service as we all know,6/3/2020,Advice,Competitive mentions/intel,2020.2,FY21 Q2
28,Mike Dorosh,Cloud (VCPP),the next phase of this hybriddistributedpublic vs private vs it services market is going to be around this you guys are positioned in a lot of ways because of your history and dominance in the old model and more importantly the things youve done in the last couple of years to potentially become that operating stack that ties a lot of this together you will have to go out and create some defensive comparison and proactive messaging to your customer set people are going to make tooling decisions in the next 6 months and stuck with them for 24 years,6/3/2020,Advice,Messaging,2020.2,FY21 Q2
29,Sid Nag,Cloud (VCPP),yes youll have to think about how to position against some of the capabilities that cloud brokers are doing look at accenture cloud platform or a multicloud manager from ibm or a service mesh or aginity from exc or cloud360 from cognizent they have some of these functions so you want to make sure that you are positioned competitively against those providers as well,6/3/2020,Advice,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2020.2,FY21 Q2
30,Mike Dorosh,Cloud (VCPP),or complimentary against those providers as well thats the other part of it a lot of this stuff can be plugged into a lot of those platforms,6/3/2020,Advice,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2020.2,FY21 Q2
31,Mike Dorosh,Cloud (VCPP),to the tooling piece ibm dxcl the big guys would much rather integrate 80 percent into that 20 percent the other end of the scale the smaller and midsize providers still see value in tooling ip i think the play here is one of market education good briefing,6/3/2020,Neutral,Marketing Awareness,2020.2,FY21 Q2
32,Eugene Quillen,Cloud (VCPP),up until recently we didnt see a lot of vcpp deals vmwareare is forcing us to drop our elas and join vcpp they were comfortable with the old model,6/5/2020,Neutral,Partnerships,2020.2,FY21 Q2
33,Eugene Quillen,Cloud (VCPP),whats unique is that some customers dont fall into the cloud provider bucket and theyve been told even for their own internal needs they will need to go to the vcpp model,6/5/2020,Neutral,Partnerships,2020.2,FY21 Q2
34,Eugene Quillen,Cloud (VCPP),you said you dont require it thats really different from what we are hearing from clients their account folks are saying they dont have a choice and have to go on vcpp,6/5/2020,Neutral,Partnerships,2020.2,FY21 Q2
35,Eugene Quillen,Cloud (VCPP),its coming from lots of different clients an educational client government maybe service providers who dont do it for their own internal use but using it all on the consumption model they are being told they have one choice only if they are providing internal services to a shared services organization they could still go ela for that type of usage,6/5/2020,Neutral,Partnerships,2020.2,FY21 Q2
36,Mark Lockwood,VMC on AWS,theres an elephant in the room here and that is that you are competing with yourself what is vmwareares advice to customers who are considering horizon on vmware cloud on aws vs horizon cloud  they are two offerings providing a similar outcome of windows 10 desktops i wanted to get your idea of where your customers are landing but it sounds like they are landing on both sides depending on what they want,6/15/2020,Neutral,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2020.2,FY21 Q2
37,Julia Palmer,VMC on AWS,is it safe to assume that the majority of the implementations are in aws or do you have breakdown versus outside of aws the majority of our customers are talking about vmc on aws i know you are supported on multiple clouds,6/15/2020,Positive,Adoption,2020.2,FY21 Q2
38,Eugene Quillen,VMC on AWS,aws has set up these enterprise contract terms that are reasonably acceptable to clients as well as to the isvs it facilities customers signing up to that enteprrise agreement once and no matter what vendor they deal with theyve already got prenegotiated terms they dont have to negotiate with you and every other vendor that sales on the marketplace its one set of terms that applies to everyone universally that they are doing business with,6/16/2020,Neutral,Pricing/packaging,2020.2,FY21 Q2
39,Eugene Quillen,VMC on AWS,i havent had any customers tell me that they found it awkward or anything so its working obviously i just worry that there could be a relationship problem here if they decided to go with aws that it would impact the help and support they get from the other things it sounds like you made that really not the case,6/16/2020,Positive,Partnerships,2020.2,FY21 Q2
40,Eugene Quillen,VMC on AWS,i appreciate you taking the customer first perspective its not always the case it sounds like youve been successful at it so from someone else who is focused on serving those customers i really do appreciate that and your time to share your story and your system and solution go to market are going out the door and how they are working and what your plans are,6/16/2020,Positive,Customer Related,2020.2,FY21 Q2
41,Michael Warrilow,Outpost (VMC on AWS),why vmc on aws outposts vs vmc on dell emc i understand one is going inward to outward and this is sort of the opposite i think educating customers or prospects around that is going to be a bit of a challenge,6/30/2020,Neutral,Customer Related,2020.2,FY21 Q2
42,Michael Warrilow,Outpost (VMC on AWS),youve got 4000 partners who can manage the infrastructure on a customers behalf you can certainly have the same management tools for that the workload portability comes along for the ride in any vmwareare combination i guess the sddc piece in the righthand one it really only seems getting a cloudstyle consumption on prem,6/30/2020,Neutral,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2020.2,FY21 Q2
43,Michael Warrilow,Outpost (VMC on AWS),regarding a comparison document between vmc on aws outposts vs dell emc its not so much the best child its more picking the right option for your child,6/30/2020,Advice,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2020.2,FY21 Q2
44,Carl Brooks,VMC on AWS,but it vmc on aws neatly hit the spot between demand for cloud transformation and migration   the great majority of enterprises have engaged in significant cloud computing deployments according to fourfiveone researchs voice of the enterprise survey data  and a great deal of that consumption was slated for aws ,6/24/2020,Positive,Use cases,2020.2,FY21 Q2

278,Phil Dawson,Cloud Foundation,what ive gotten on reflection of the days activities is that your messaging generally is to expand the business and expand the core what i cant get in my head is how much can vmwareare drive consternation at the core vs expand the core if you transform the core pieces that you have which is big do you keep that customer longterm there is a difference between a transformation and an expansion to your client retention you did a lot of brownfield messaging really well today you need a message for greenfield opportunities,6/30/2020,Advice,Messaging,2020.2,FY21 Q2

280,Julia Palmer,HCI/vSAN,were starting to see people going back to 3tier infrastructure because its not more money now and its simple to manage they have a reliable performance and its low risk you need to take another look at that and see how you can promote hci in those new terms we talk about promoting innovation in hardware without you actually handling the hardware stack its very difficult to push it forward people fall back and that creates a perception of not being performant in storage when its maybe actually poorly configured its not about acquiring new customers its about creating a perception of vmwareare hci as very well suited for your applications ive seen inquiries where dell emc and their integrators could have been much more efficient with vxrail but customers are not aware that there are a lot of parameters and hardware innovations vxrail that they can leverage for the same level of performance,6/30/2020,Advice,Messaging,2020.2,FY21 Q2

289,Julia Palmer,Cloud Foundation,regarding private cloud or an extension to hybrid one thing we do see is that cost justification they dont want to be in the dc or the colo business other than that one thing you can promote is that you can deploy the same stack on different cloudsrepatriation is not possible due to different apis have to refactor apps back to on prem with vcf on different cloud providers infrastructure that can last and support changes you guys should talk about infrastructure that can support changes rather than infrastructure that lasts you have all those initiatives this is how vmwareare is supporting change rather than just virtualized compute,6/30/2020,Neutral,Customer Related,2020.2,FY21 Q2

449,Arun Chandrasekaran,Cloud Native Storage,in the last 18 mos we are seeing more stateful workloads being deployed on containers and kubernetes seeing different patterns of workloads starting to see interest in legacy apps including java dark net typeits too big a statement to make yet that k8s is the de facto way they want to consume infrastructure thats true for coastal america not main street america yet but the value proposition there is 1 we are already deploying containers we are already thinking of cloud migration lets try to align those strategies together  2 the big gating factor for us from an enterprise standpoint is we just dont have the skills around it lets start experimenting lets start building skills around it whether we liftandshift or refactor we are gaining knowledgeyoure starting to see a lot of interest in containerizing big data apps particularly kafka and spark the ml and ai types of apps its very early days a lot of interest in things like kubeflow some of those higher level workload engines can build upon the underlying container runtime and k8s platformgartner thinks that today perhaps 40 of those big data workloads are run in the cloud,5/18/2020,Neutral,Customer Related,2020.2,FY21 Q2
450,Arun Chandrasekaran,Cloud Native Storage,data protection is very different for these workloads because of the dynamism of containers because youre spinning them up and spinning them down very fast containers can be ephemeral pushing persistent data beyond that limited time with containers i get the value proposition but surprisingly from a gartner inquiry standpoint we get inquiries around primary storage but we rarely get inquiries around backup or dr for containerized workloads yet,5/18/2020,Neutral,Customer Related,2020.2,FY21 Q2

458,Arun Chandrasekaran,Cloud Native Storage,portworx is the most common and popular vendor in cloud native storage with more customers than most other container storage vendors 125200 estimated paying customers good mindshare particularly with big wall street banks in the knowhow of this ecosystem thinks this is due to being early to market softwaredriven architecture where its not just software but theyve also architected their storage software as a set of containers using microservices architecture they talk  deeply about  being container native snapshotting replication and encryption theyve thought about this in terms of a container volume level or a kubernetes pod level that level of granularity theyve formed a decent partnership with redhat wouldnt call them highly successfulwouldnt call anyone highly successful in this marketplace but they are closest they come up in inquiry more than any other vendor and are getting into the secondary storage space still a primary storage vendor but seeing more opportunities for backup and dr the last couple of briefings they almost exclusively talked about developing those capabilitiesportworx is very expensive a lot of the data science use cases tend to be open sourceoriented rather than commercial retoolingoriented for early adopters so portworx is more lift and shift and big data workloads,5/18/2020,Neutral,Competitive mentions/intel,2020.2,FY21 Q2
459,Arun Chandrasekaran,Cloud Native Storage,portworxs value is in providing data services that mean something to developers speaking to them in a language they understand they want to think about containers and they want to think about storage  directly linked to a kubernetes pod or container theyve started positioning their value as we provide data services and we can sit on top of any storage even if you have commodity storage we can sit on top of your local host our value is in providing data or software services on top of it the other part of it is the multicloud multiorchestration play which is we dont want to be competing with any of them we will integrate with openshift or gke if you want to run it in google cloud they became a little more in line with where they can make their software available they also make sure theyre available in the marketplace with a lot of other gtm plays to ensure customers could get access to their software faster,5/18/2020,Neutral,Competitive mentions/intel,2020.2,FY21 Q2
460,Arun Chandrasekaran,Cloud Native Storage,its a revolving door at robin their message is confusing robin is often conflicted with seeing storage as a bad word they started with we have a kubernetes distribution you dont actually need openshift only 2 of 100 doors opened i told them they dont want to be a k8s distribution dont compete with vmwareare and redhat you dont have the bandwidth or the wherewithal to do it they talk about this application virtualization or application services on top of it trying to shoot for something theyre not big data database workloads have not been able to execute well especially compared to somebody like portworx who has done reasonably well in this space many vendors in this space dont have bad technology per se but didnt get positioning gtm and execution right,5/18/2020,Neutral,Competitive mentions/intel,2020.2,FY21 Q2
461,Arun Chandrasekaran,Cloud Native Storage,in container storage pricing can be a differentiator building a close integration with a big platform provider can be a good selling point as well for example google redhat or even vmwareare although vmware doesnt need anyone that could be a good play in itself because google is trying to make a strong foray into an onpremises data center redhat is everywhere in this space pricing is a value prop so many customers have come back to us and said we think we could have paid portworx as much as we are paying for the primary platform vendor doesnt make sense we pay a vendor x for the kubernetes distro and we think we are  paying portworx the same amount of money just to store the data,5/18/2020,Neutral,Competitive mentions/intel,2020.2,FY21 Q2
462,Arun Chandrasekaran,Cloud Native Storage,arrikto arun likes what they are doing has only spoken to them once but likes what theyre doing their value proposition is quite differentiated there is a certain category of workloads where fast storage is becoming important primary interface at this point in time they are out of the io path they also seem very focused on the use cases and are  working closely with kubeflow its a bit of a white space its not very competitive or commoditized they dont have to compete with the big storage vendors i thought it was interesting they focused on highspeed block storage in the market and again some of the control plane capabilities that theyve built where theyre able to do snapshots and so on that are outside of the io path creating a high level of performance without being in the io path,5/18/2020,Neutral,Competitive mentions/intel,2020.2,FY21 Q2

565,Julia Palmer,Cloud Native Storage,when you talk to those making purchases for container native storage their goal is to never talk to it ever again ideal of the primary storage guys is to have a csi plugin and mission accomplished its not going to work because they want everything to align to the same kubernetes principles which is software defined can be deployed anywhere edge cloud whatever distributed design which is critical not where if it goes down your entire cluster goes down also aligns with kubernetes even in the pricing model which as you know is usually per node so now they think it would be nice to also price storage per node so theres been a breakthrough almost in the practices as well,5/11/2020,Neutral,Customer Related,2020.2,FY21 Q2

574,Julia Palmer,Cloud Native Storage,arrikto has a unique approach they use an object storage you can call it a staging area or data staging its really good because you also use it as a transient layer you have a snapshot in object storage then you can move it to the public cloud you can utilize the same apis on prem or at the public cloud low entry is the beauty of their solution you already have a node that you deployed your pod on large projects see a name theyve never heard of and are scared to invest with them to get in and out with a massive amount of data is not easy one thing i love about this approach is the idea that you have a high performance primary storage then unstructured data designed for scale they work together as a single tier if persistent storage going to grow for containers its going to grow for the applications that need a lot of it like aiml arriktos approach is most interesting in the market if you want large scale they can give it high performance they can give it thats one of the more flexible environments otherwise you get stuck in a sort of a hyperconverged model heres your storage heres your compute what if my requirements change and i need more compute  theyre really small and its going to be very difficult for them to grow but i feel like their approach overall is the right approach for data services,5/11/2020,Neutral,Competitive mentions/intel,2020.2,FY21 Q2

603,Anne Thomas,Tanzu,customers want to get rid of oracle and replace with postgres get rid of expensive middleware and replace with open source,5/7/2020,Advice,Developer Strategy,2020.2,FY21 Q2
604,Anne Thomas,Tanzu,there is a significant shift away from java ee to open source fair number of organizations moving from oracle to postgres because of license costs integration is a bigger effort to port,5/7/2020,Neutral,Developer Strategy,2020.2,FY21 Q2
605,Anne Thomas,Tanzu,gartners position is that open source in the longrun is not less expensive dont have lots of license fees but have subscription fees or support costs many hire consultants earlier in the process,5/7/2020,Neutral,Developer Strategy,2020.2,FY21 Q2

609,Anne Thomas,Tanzu,users like cf experience they are concerned and nervous they are asking if they should continue with old or move to kubernetes based system fud is out there it is a safer bet to go with kubernetes now not comfortable pas will be around in 10 years vmwareare website doesnt include pks or pas so leads people to believe it will be shortlived,5/7/2020,Negative,Messaging,2020.2,FY21 Q2
610,Anne Thomas,Tanzu,from a messaging perspective promotion of new kubernetes based narrative is potentially inadvertently creating a story that pas is going away customers are not sure if they should continue to make investments advised pivotal to make noise that pas will be supported and a smooth migration to tas once there is feature parity,5/7/2020,Negative,Messaging,2020.2,FY21 Q2
611,Anne Thomas,Tanzu,gartner isnt hearing anything about a paas that doesnt involve tas could use spring on top of raw kubernetes and build systems that way if using openshift and java probably using springboot 75 of java developers are using spring boot no requirement to use tas because targeting a kubernetes platform,5/7/2020,Neutral,Messaging,2020.2,FY21 Q2

613,Anne Thomas,Tanzu,if vmwareare only offered a highly opinionated environment you would lose clients certain people appreciate a highly opinionated environment because it guides them they may not have a high degree of expertise also looking for productivity advancements that they would get from an opinionated environment on the other hand if you have a very sophisticated team they may want to do it in their own way and may not want an opinionated model  you also have some teams which are focused on performance and scale and they think they can do a better job if they can do it themselves  you also have a bunch of folks who are not building in java they are using python or ruby or something else can run anything want inside a kubernetes container,5/7/2020,Advice,Developer Strategy,2020.2,FY21 Q2
614,Anne Thomas,Tanzu,people do lift and shift it is hard to do lift and shift into pas assume that will be the same with taz both of those presume that you are following the opinionated model and building wellstructed architectures if i have a java on top of ibm liberty i just want to pick it up and move it im not going to rearchitect to make it more concise like the taz framework that was a big advantage that openshift had over pivotal in that it did have better support for the lift and shift model,5/7/2020,Neutral,Developer Strategy,2020.2,FY21 Q2

616,Anne Thomas,Tanzu,arc is limited to azure and onprem very similar to outposts there are azure and aws customers happy to just have those two options so they are not looking for diversity for their cloud platforms talked to a number of orgs that are not nearly as concerned with portability they will pick the platform to run it on and stay there not looking for an out  other companies have a strong principle that says that they have to have an exit strategy for applications and must have the ability to move apps from one platform to another two opposite extremes but most are in the middle,5/7/2020,Neutral,Competitive mentions/intel,2020.2,FY21 Q2
617,Anne Thomas,Tanzu,would a multicloud developer ecosystem help even if using tanzu on 4 different platforms   still lots of portability needed to move things around still using a bunch of native services like identity management probably my persistence model and analytics models will be different as i move from one to another even if i have a set of cncf technologies certainly the ones running inside container system i expect that but that is not the whole story there are things that have to connect with that are outside the scope not sure it dramatically improves,5/7/2020,Advice,Developer Strategy,2020.2,FY21 Q2
618,Anne Thomas,Tanzu,right now i can build my own stack based on everything sponsored by cncf or by other 3rd party systems almost everyone is using using istio   not cncf or they are using console which is not cncf can use that in any kubernetes system so i can move it around anything inside k8s is relatively easy to port,5/7/2020,Advice,Developer Strategy,2020.2,FY21 Q2

721,Michael Warrilow,BitFusion,i think youre way ahead of the market there are 2 very different messaging and positioning strategies aim at meeting them in the middle most of the technology will go way over the head of the classic vmwareare crowd for the data analysts help them get out of diy and grow their confidence that they can hand the platform over to the io team your messaging of vmware investing to support modern applications continues and continues to resonate a subset of the first group may be technically aware but will be the minority need messaging that is super simple literally 3 or 4 words to stay in their minds like nsx is the hypervisor for the network,4/28/2020,Advice,Messaging,2020.1,FY21 Q1
722,John Abbott,BitFusion,questions in bitfusion briefing can you pool the memory just wondering the way it connects up gpus together and coordinates the memory between the cpu and the gpu for instance its something ive been trying to work on just wondering how that works depending on the interconnects inside the cuda server i think it was mentioned you do that within the serverdo you view cuda as a proprietary control point would you like this to come together into some sort of standard thats not just nvidia gpuspecificis this more applicable to ml training on big gpu setups than inference which is going to be distributed around the edge and various parts of the cloud does it remain as applicable as we see more inference and less trainingyoure offering as sw and dell offering as an appliance will you offer it as a cloud service as well,4/28/2020,Neutral,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2020.1,FY21 Q1
723,Michael Warrilow,BitFusion,top line i think this is pretty cool pretty sexy to the classic vmwareare crowd they wont be particularly familiar with it but more highend enterprise customers are going to be starting to become aware some of examples you gave are spoton,4/28/2020,Positive,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2020.1,FY21 Q1

725,Michael Warrilow,BitFusion,caution you dont want to build too much momentum and have a whole bunch of vi admins go off and think they are data scientists there has to be a credibility story an education for them you dont want to set them loose and the data scientists go what the hell do they think theyre doing the other battle youll have if you do win that one will be getting away from the not invented here syndrome,4/28/2020,Advice,Strategy,2020.1,FY21 Q1
726,Michael Warrilow,BitFusion,another question from customers will be yes i can use bitfusion but why vmwareare as opposed to amazon or google thats a more fundamental question you can get the messaging right but what if no one hears it how do you seed an interest in doing this themselves rather than in public cloud its already here included in vsphere enterprise  licensing so thats good no one wants to spend any more,4/28/2020,Advice,Messaging,2020.1,FY21 Q1
727,Michael Warrilow,BitFusion,your business case is continuing to maintain vspheres relevance its about maintaining that story for the data scientist and helping them get out of diy then theres the broad message timeline the only obstacle choose the right workloads heres where were going meet in the middle with credibility the hybrid story of yourourtheir place that message has lots of good classic vmwareare themes,4/28/2020,Advice,Messaging,2020.1,FY21 Q1

735,Michael Warrilow,BitFusion,theres a growing sense that anything you do with vmwareare is going to be some big upsell and some big suite this bitfusion is a function that most of them will now automatically have whatever version of enterprise plus they have that removes friction to seed that market with such a massive install base to be able to leverage its a less confrontational way than vmware has done with some of its other products like nsx this will leave a sweeter taste in their mouths theres a continuation of modernizing applications planting the seed giving them some inspiration and lighting up their imaginations for how they could make this possible in a pretty easy way for applications that are coming down the road and in those particular verticals like financial services that are always looking for a way to get ahead of the competition in things like trading,4/27/2020,Positive,Pricing,2020.1,FY21 Q1

753,Arun Chandrasekaran,BitFusion,clearly separate existing vsphere customers from new customers the value for them is a common management plane they can run their existing workloads as well as next generation workloads like aiml workloads the value proposition there is much more focused on continuity you wont spin up an entirely new infrastructure you want to put new ai workloads on your existing infrastructure you can have the same level of manageability and better efficiencies with the virtualization technology that bitfusion brings to gpus to existing vsphere customers the message is continuity in terms of having a same consistent api same consistent operating model same consistent infrastructure but with better efficiencies particularly for gpus and eventually for the other abstractions as well as well as a much easier manageability they will get with a vcentertype of a management platform rather than trying to do bare metal mgmt this is an easier story to tell,4/23/2020,Advice,Messaging,2020.1,FY21 Q1
754,Arun Chandrasekaran,BitFusion,the more difficult story for vmwareare is to convince new customers or new buying centers and new workloads that customers are onboarding that this is the right platformnew buyers that are deploying aiml workloads are not only the io buyers in some organizations who have more mature analytics practices the io folks have gained enough trust and confidence that the questions around infrastructure selection and management of the infrastructure is left to them but a lot of organizations where they are starting anew those infrastructure decisions arent always made by io they may be made by the data science team or an ml engineer who probably comes from a devops background or a software engineering devops background but is also tasked with running ml they arent aware of vmwares value proposition in this space or dont see vmware as strategic vendor when youre talking about new buying centers i would argue that mlengineering is a new role and many organizations are struggling to even hire those ml engineers youve got to have a messaging targeted to them that is a little more distinct,4/23/2020,Advice,Messaging,2020.1,FY21 Q1
755,Arun Chandrasekaran,BitFusion,he didnt see this story which vmwareare should tell the perennial question should i run my aiml workloads in a vm or just bare metal for better performance and now theres the whole containers  kubernetes question a lot of interest in running ml workloads in a container in a vm or in a container on bare metal value prop we can get some of the benefits of bare metal in terms of performance but at the same time we can get better application packaging better manageability for our mlworkloads,4/23/2020,Advice,Messaging,2020.1,FY21 Q1
756,Arun Chandrasekaran,BitFusion,vmwareare is obviously pushing aggressively with integrating kubernetes into the vsphere and some of the work being done there on the control plane side of the house like tanzu mission control theres an opportunity to tell that story we can enable some of these structures as well,4/23/2020,Advice,Messaging,2020.1,FY21 Q1

758,Arun Chandrasekaran,BitFusion,ive spent a lot of time on the containers and kubernetes ecosystem theres interesting work happening within the community kubeflow and so on ecosystem vendors are aggressively pushing that idea to customers the idea of containers being a de facto abstraction architectural images are all containerized images you just need to have a very strong story around the tradeoffs between running bitfusion in a vm vs running in a container and how vmwareare is not just in one bucket or slot here,4/23/2020,Advice,Messaging,2020.1,FY21 Q1
759,Arun Chandrasekaran,BitFusion,many cases of doing distributed machine learning when we talk with customers on ml amazed they bought these great boxes but their infrastructure is very 20th century they have not upgraded their infrastructure like buying a lamborghini to drive it in traffic you can explain what needs to happen apart from the compute infrastructure itself help customers maximize the value of their investments,4/23/2020,Neutral,Customer Related,2020.1,FY21 Q1
760,Arun Chandrasekaran,BitFusion,asked what he is seeing as adoption rates with customers for ai said it depends on the industry and use case are they building ai or piloting ai in general seeing almost 23 to 13 of on prem vs cloud based cloud based seem much smaller workloads specifically in financial services investment banking insurance some of those deployments are pretty big big in media and entertainment some in healthcare beyond that many are really pilots bold prediction put out last year more than half of ml models piloted never make it into production theres lots of tire kicking,4/23/2020,Neutral,Adoption,2020.1,FY21 Q1

779,Chirag Dekate,BitFusion,most of the market trying to figure out what ai means if inquiries are an indication things are moving forward this year quite a bit shifting toward virtualization many of these organizations have put together pocs and now they are trying to put together shareable platforms they can use across multiple projects most of orgs i engage with are in this spectrum many are oil and gas and financial services capital one is very advanced in machine learning also jj and home depot and their use case is mature the tendency is for each data scientist to use their own gpu it leaders are very frustrated by that that just cannot scale in an enterprise ecosystem need shared resources that a broader pool of end users can access very distinct need in the market for production platforms that enable shared utilization of highend resources like gpus,4/20/2020,Neutral,Adoption,2020.1,FY21 Q1
780,Chirag Dekate,BitFusion,end users are trying to figure out how to create shareable deep learning training platforms to use across multiple products this is where the bitfusion value proposition really shines,4/20/2020,Positive,Customer Related,2020.1,FY21 Q1
781,Chirag Dekate,BitFusion,use cases the sort of training portion with shareability of large contiguous blocks of gpus makes a lot of sense primarily because of the data access and such the single gpus scavenging for use cases which bitfusion also enables across the cluster those kinds of resources might be really useful and easier to market towards inference workloads in the data center i think the combination of these two provides vmwareare a unique portfolio,4/20/2020,Positive,Use cases,2020.1,FY21 Q1
782,Chirag Dekate,BitFusion,with capital one theyre actually not doing deep learning training in many cases theyre doing machine learning i dont think they are using highend gpus yet except for their image recognitionoriented workloads and i think their languagetranslation workloads the reason theyre not doing deep learning has to do with financial regulations but also the data they have at hand is very different in most cases financial services from a marketing perspective uses a very different modeling mix than for example health care or even oil and gas more of an imaging kind of a workload that is not productionready because of the regulatory environment and the models having to be explainable and transparent so theres no bias in the model we often see end users sticking with machine learning,4/20/2020,Neutral,Use cases,2020.1,FY21 Q1
783,Chirag Dekate,BitFusion,with deep learning we are not seeing widespread adoption just yet but that doesnt mean it wont happen it takes time if you put yourself in the end users shoes with respect to deep learning the number one bottle neck you run into is actually not the infrastructure side its on the data side how do you actually get the data sets youre a phone screen manufacturer youre trying to detect defects in the phone screens in the form of scratches during the manufacturing process youre going to need a lot of images of scratched screens during the manufacturing process those data sets need to be curated and created tagged and such in sufficient volumes depending on the industry you run into different maturity models and use cases and this is just a view from a data perspective,4/20/2020,Neutral,Use cases,2020.1,FY21 Q1
784,Chirag Dekate,BitFusion,i want vmwareare to avoid the mistake other vendors have made which is to overinvest in their gpu strategy presuming that having a gpu enables ai avenues it does not if you look at how their end users are starting out this has very little mention of a gpu gpus make sense as part of an overall strategy when you are launching your bitfusion product please emphasize the fact that you are still addressing the broader aiml workload but in this particular capability you are actually focusing on the deep learning sharing of platforms for deep learning always emphasize that vmwares ai strategy is not just deep learning it is actually machine learning plus deep learning i think you will find that enterprise end users barely understand gpus,4/20/2020,Advice,Strategy,2020.1,FY21 Q1
785,Chirag Dekate,BitFusion,nvidia absolutely dominate the market theres no point wasting time on anybody else  it makes sense to focus there right now but that may be about to change i suspect youre very wellaware of amds roadmap and how they are competitively placed from a gpu standpoint intel i dont know what to believe anymore so i am waiting to see a sustainable product in the market we just havent seen it yet they did acquire habana ai chipmaker habana labs they do have a cogent oneapi strategyno updates since the habana acquisition dont know what the new strategy looks like which is disappointing i dont see them show up in customer conversations i have not run into a successful use case yet i wanted to caution you on that,4/20/2020,Advice,Partner readiness,2020.1,FY21 Q1
786,Chirag Dekate,BitFusion,i think the overall strategy you are putting in place i am for being able to provide a shareable gpu resource across multiple teams is a capability that end users constantly ask for they cannot afford standing up a new gpu cluster either on prem or in the cloud for different pocs that are going on simultaneously how do i share platforms and share my gpu resources across different teams vmwareare has a solution no one else has figured out  even nvidiastrangelymaybe they might actually not be motivated to come up with a shared solution so at least for now yours is one of the few platforms that provides this in an enterprise context so really really good product and i would love to be a media reference for this,4/20/2020,Positive,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2020.1,FY21 Q1
787,Chirag Dekate,BitFusion,when asked if china is going to lead the aiml market and is likely to lead in developing standards the activity in china is interesting because there are national security implications to it the sanctions have caused a very interesting effect in china they have actually accelerated indigenous production of technologies almost every single vendor i have engaged with have created their own custom gpu chips and they have created their own technology roadmaps mainly because the defense ecosystems have been prevented from accessing nvidia technologies there are spillover effects into other markets they want to dominate ai as well as quantum hpc technologies partly because they are crucial and mission critical to what they are trying to do in many cases they are starting to develop hardware technologies along that directionbut i have not seen them develop anything in the software ecosystems and standardizations just yet i think china is playing the long game like the hardware server ecosystem,4/20/2020,Neutral,Competitive mentions/intel,2020.1,FY21 Q1

864,Lydia Leong,Cloud (VCPP),during a vmwareare cloud provider inquiry i dont see the same level of interest in avs as with aws the reason is the hypervisor a lot of our clients who go to vmc when they are doing an aws migration are doing so explicitly because they need to run a supported hypervisor for whatever isv they are using or they are looking for vmwarebased solution and they enjoy the first party and they dont care about the aws part so much its an economical way makes auditing more easier for the ones who care about the cloud side of it the customer tends to be larger more heterogeneous and they are filling in the blanks on isv licensing,4/14/2020,Neutral,Competitive mentions/intel,2020.1,FY21 Q1

1210,Stephen Elliot,vSphere 7 with K8s,this is a big deal from a company standpoint your sales folks and developers arent used to thinking like this and youre attacking it from the infrastructure up and apps down sides it will be fascinating to see driving linkages from your core strengths youll have to answer for developers why should i care and how do you make my life easier what problem are you solving for me today they have lots of problems they have traditionally solved with having 54 tools and they dont want to be told what to use will be fascinating to see which groups of developers come on board these developers are so saturated with marketing messages its an interesting opportunity and a big role is some of your partners not the telcos accenture and dxc have dev ops practices take those folks and harness their work with you a lot of work here partner development sales teams big step for the company this will be a digestion year for your customers,3/5/2020,Advice,Adoption,2020.1,FY21 Q1
1211,Stephen Elliot,vSphere 7 with K8s,its reasonable to say there could be some it spend slowdown this year or a recession vmwareare should look at this model and think about use cases this is about productivity increases and cost optimization you get more out of who you have in the past two recessions this has worked very well with cios havent had to hire more people etc id be hyperaggressive get the attention of people willing to bet on this story tell them what youve done with some early customers,3/5/2020,Advice,Messaging,2020.1,FY21 Q1

1222,Chris Gardner,vSphere 7 with K8s,i used to be a vmwareare admin the namespace functionality grouping all the objects that together are a logical application from vmware on the vm side was amazing except populating it was always a challenge when this was in the realm of an io person having to create it and manage it they never did a good job but whenever it was the developers who manage it and make the changes and say these pieces link to form an application in my experience it was a much  better situation regardless having the functionality is pretty darn good the developer manages what is grouped into a namespace to indicate a logical application in vsphere 7 with kubernetes  maybe im geeking out a little bit i like this granted there are other ways to do stuff like this through other construction layers but i like that you guys are folding it into the classic vmware admin capabilities and saying this is an additional thing you need to know because its important to your developers,3/3/2020,Positive,Developer Strategy,2020.1,FY21 Q1
1223,Dave Bartoletti,vSphere 7 with K8s,regarding it setting up namespaces for logical applications and developers being in charge of putting vms  containers into the namespace for that logical app he thinks developers will say i dont want to do this i dont have to do this in aws i dont have to call the admin at aws and have them define a space for me to do this stuff youre asking to step back and go back to the old days submit a ticket to create a namespace j rosoff pointed out you can set up permissions to allow the developer to set up their own namespaces,3/3/2020,Negative,Developer Strategy,2020.1,FY21 Q1
1224,Dave Bartoletti,vSphere 7 with K8s,i think as usual this makes an amazing amount of sense to me for someone who needs to be building kubernetes clusters in their data center to start rolling out applications its the multicloud aspect where it gets confusing you dont want to focus on just one market especially an onprem market thats the challenge that customers are going to face do i want to extend the way i manage infrastructure and apps in my data center to cover everything wherever it runs i think thats a question chris gardner and i will be getting from our clients a lot but that question has been the same since the beginning of cloud do i move application monitoring do i buy thousands of more licenses for onprem application monitoring tools to monitor my apps in the cloud or do i buy native cloud monitoring tools yes i have multiple tools and theyre all designed for the places i am using them j rosoff pointed out tkg is our true multicloud k8s distro and this is for people wanting to use k8s on prem,3/3/2020,Negative,Strategy,2020.1,FY21 Q1
1225,Dave Bartoletti,vSphere 7 with K8s,youre going to have to rebuild a bunch of faas databases messaging service mesh all on top of this to give developers the same sort of experience they would get natively in the public cloud the real action here is were not trying to change how developers build apps in the public cloud were trying to change how it can operate the stuff they produce response in part rather than trying to recreate all those services ourselves were going to embrace the ecosystem here and try to leverage all the development thats happening on those isvs to bring bestinclass services anywhere you have this platform,3/3/2020,Negative,Strategy,2020.1,FY21 Q1

1232,Angelina Troy,Cloud (VCPP),disaster recovery is becoming a more common theme than it has in the past typical conversation were moving to cloud were going to have less stuff on prem could we get to the point where we could close our secondary data center it is the most common theme that i end up having around that the second most common is that we would like to do dr as the first stepping stone in a path to  migrating to the public cloud,2/28/2020,Neutral,Strategy,2020.1,FY21 Q1
1233,Angelina Troy,Cloud (VCPP),as that relates to various vmwareare services i would say that at this point im roughly willing to say that if people are aligning to aws as their public cloud provider of choice theyre also roughly speaking aligning to vmc on aws i have more conversations where someone says hey im rehosting a bunch of stuff i want to know what is the process what are the tools where does vmc on aws make sense or does cloud simple and azure make sense its a more common point of the conversation that being said the number of inquiries i take specific to vmc on aws or cloud simple that hasnt gone up actually but its become a more common point of discussion in other calls that are more generally about cloud migration,2/28/2020,Neutral,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2020.1,FY21 Q1
1234,Angelina Troy,Cloud (VCPP),i talk to more rehost people than my colleagues i take a good portion of rehost calls in the overall scheme of calls that touch on cloud migration i think 5060 involve a fairly significant rehost effort leaning toward the majority of it i would say somewhere between 4050 are thinking we are going to go much more heavily in the paas direction,2/28/2020,Neutral,Customer Related,2020.1,FY21 Q1
1235,Angelina Troy,Cloud (VCPP),ive run into three profiles to the cloud 1 the group that is cloudonly which is moving everything to the cloud 2 cloud first which is moving something to the cloud and default it to the cloud 3 cloud opportunistic which is if it makes sense well move it to the cloud i see cloud opportunistic orgs more and more,2/28/2020,Neutral,Customer Related,2020.1,FY21 Q1
1236,Angelina Troy,Cloud (VCPP),its getting to the point where everybody i talk to has some sort of cloud strategy it may not be wholly baked but theyve got one at this point its getting harder and harder for me to run into somebody who doesnt already have something in iaas or paas it doesnt have to be much but its hard to find something who doesnt have some stuff up there testing it or otherwise on the more governance pieces in the cloud first strategy i would say that most of them have a good landing zone at least they may not have been too far into putting applications there but they have something that they are willing to call a production grade landing zone more than half of them have something like that in that cloud first bucket its almost impossible for me to find somebody that doesnt have saas,2/28/2020,Neutral,Customer Related,2020.1,FY21 Q1
1237,Angelina Troy,Cloud (VCPP),among those who want to be 100 cloud almost to a person they are early in their adoption process i usually start off the conversation with most people change their minds once reality sets in most groups realize that this didnt make a whole ton of sense the exception might be small medium businesses where it actually is feasible to do so the overwhelming majority of them are of that early adopter were going to go gungho cloud and i would bet money that a year and a half from now they will see that didnt work out and they definitely scaled that back,2/28/2020,Neutral,Customer Related,2020.1,FY21 Q1
1238,Angelina Troy,VMC on AWS,regarding the vmwareare cloud offerings comparison draft report vmc on aws did very well you only had a single low on configuration flexibility it came down to something you will roll out later this year   the flexibility to use the ebs storage for any configuration  that would bump you up to a medium on that point otherwise you are at mediums and highs for everything which is the best among the vendors outside cloud provider integration so you are doing pretty well,2/28/2020,Positive,Competitive mentions/intel,2020.1,FY21 Q1

1242,Angelina Troy,VMC on IBM,ibm performs well in flexibility of configuration as well as they match you on global availability since they are in a lot of different places they also have a lot of configuration flexibility because they do customize a fair bit but that gives them some issues on cluster elasticity and some of the scalability on the low end so theres a trade off there they have really good configuration options,2/28/2020,Neutral,Competitive mentions/intel,2020.1,FY21 Q1
1243,Angelina Troy,VMC on Microsoft,microsofts big thing is their cloud provider integration i would say they are the best in that area overall they are middle of the road for most other things the one that bummed me out is that they havent rolled this out to be much of a footprint on azure quite yet i mean come on,2/28/2020,Neutral,Competitive mentions/intel,2020.1,FY21 Q1
1244,Michael Warrilow,Cloud (VCPP),during a vmwareare cloud provider update google by cloud simple was a bit of a cunning move and a disruption to what microsoft does a big one really what virtustream is doing   do you guys get involved in that microsoft made a solid commitment and it kind of felt like they got the rug pulled out from under them i cant imagine it having occurred without cloud simple as that middle man in the first place now that its established youre probably right its not needed anymore if i was google and i wanted to be nasty it would be a good way to throw a wrench into microsoft its something ill discuss with clients trying to choose between various vmware hyperscalers,2/27/2020,Neutral,Competitive mentions/intel,2020.1,FY21 Q1
1245,Pam Miller,Cloud (VCPP),during a vmwareare cloud provider update as we see providers moving more and more to the edge things become very customized for the use case were actually seeing that in central data centers the smaller guys are going to be increasingly focused at the edge they will have to have customized services on top of your services interestingly a study that we did last june and im getting ready to start to field it again one of the top characteristics of why they focus on vmware as one of their prime vendors is because of the ability to extend your products and services and have tech support behind that good vote of confidence but i think keeping those partners in mind while you do these things is really important and not just focusing on the biggest guys it sounds like you are but its just really strategic to get the capabilities out there and enablement of the partners really extending your services so when the edge really pushes up into everyones face you have a team of people who can manage it,2/27/2020,Advice,Partner readiness,2020.1,FY21 Q1
1246,Pam Miller,Cloud (VCPP),during a vmwareare cloud provider update when you talk about dr and some of the common use cases you need to create a higherlevel platform to allow your providers to extend what youre doing to make it speak to what the customers look for i know you guys do that you need to do it in a way that simplifies how a provider or partner of what they need to do to get the extension simplifying blueprints etc unique to the customer than dr that everyone needs,2/27/2020,Advice,Use cases,2020.1,FY21 Q1
1247,Pam Miller,Cloud (VCPP),during a vmwareare cloud provider update i dont think any one vendor is going to be able to do all of those use cases so its going to be looking to your partners to be able to extend to those use cases and give them a higherlevel platform to do development on that 20 but that 20 makes it usable by a customer its a really important concept to look to your partners to get to more use cases instead of trying to get to all of those use cases yourself  i think this is critical to maintain the position you are developing if its too complex and somebody can come in with something thats simpler they win you have to provide this salesforce is a perfect example this is the right path,2/27/2020,Advice,Use cases,2020.1,FY21 Q1

1369,Dave Wright,VMC on AWS,microsoft licensing inquiry theres not a lot thats complicated about this until you get past the core basic use case its clearly designed to frustrate aws dedicated hosts but it has the indirect collateral effect of being impactful on googles cloud platform as well as on situations where you may decide that windows license that had been supplied by a customer in use of vcenter on prem may migrate its way to vmwareare cloud on aws or any of the other cloud platforms,2/12/2020,Neutral,Competitive mentions/intel,2020.1,FY21 Q1

1449,Dennis Smith,CloudHealth,all due respect but it is actually a long list of products some legacy that you are reengineering many from acquired companies with different architectures data stores engineering teams etc  it makes it very difficult for an enterprise to blend their strategy with such a large pool of different offerings,1/30/2020,Advice,Strategy,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1450,Dennis Smith,CloudHealth,i struggle in finding consistency with that and how your product set is playing out around that  for example if i target just one function eg cost management for my hybrid deployment ie onpremises and say azure i probably needwant two vmwareare products vrealize operations and cloudhealth which are minimally integrated tools with separate identity management data models and user interfaces  that complexity increases if i need to handle other functions with more products with different user interfaces data models etc,1/30/2020,Advice,Strategy,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1451,Dennis Smith,CloudHealth,cloudhealth is a fantastic product that has had great success but it is primarily a cost optimization tool not a cmp as we have defined it,1/30/2020,Advice,Strategy,2019.4,FY20 Q4

1457,Dennis Smith,Tanzu Observability,we are not seeing tremendous traction with these wavefront and vra offerings particularly not as standalone products that are winning bakeoffs  in fact in many ways we see your field teams struggling with how to market and sale your many offerings  in some ways that is not surprising with the many offerings,1/30/2020,Advice,Strategy,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1458,Stephen O'Grady,Tanzu,most vendors red hat included have an opslead gtm bc they dont have a direct connection with developers the cloud providers do have direct connect w devs competing w cloud providers its ibmred hat against the cloud providers essentially tough to parse the branding and brings up the point that we are entering a crowded market with a new brand curious about the decision to get rid of the pivotal brand ,1/29/2020,Neutral,Strategy,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1459,James Governor,Tanzu,be careful not to narrow the funnel with spring its a polyglot world be sure to take the outsidein perspective vmwareare has a substantial opportunity bc you have had a hand in building lots of careers of operations pros consider this as kubernetes evolves from something you had to build to use to just consuming it,1/29/2020,Neutral,Strategy,2019.4,FY20 Q4

1462,Jeffrey Hammond,Tanzu,this big question about kubernetes is past the question stage  do we use this is is now how do we make this work this may be the year that devs say this is too hard what about serverless but your clear message for 2020 should be spring cloud boot is the best way to implement kubernetes,1/28/2020,Positive,Strategy,2019.4,FY20 Q4

1545,Lydia Leong,Project Pacific,kubernetes service fabric message testing instead of infrastructure services i would say infrastructure resources because your universal service fabric is where all of the services are,1/22/2020,Advice,Messaging,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1546,Lydia Leong,Project Pacific,kubernetes service fabric message testing so service fabric means something different to a developer it invokes service mesh and things like that when they talk about service fabrics,1/22/2020,Advice,Marketing Awareness,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1547,Lydia Leong,Project Pacific,kubernetes service fabric message testing people are interested in being able to add their own services but i think everyone is challenged in building those services if you talk to someone like yefimgartner analyst hell talk a lot about people buy cloud foundry and other paasenabling fabrics to build something which is actually not a paas they never really get to the point where they have services per se they may end up with things like well you can deploy a containerized database with one click but good luck managing that thing afterwards,1/22/2020,Advice,Marketing Awareness,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1548,Lydia Leong,Project Pacific,kubernetes service fabric message testing application integrations tend to look reasonably straightforward they are across the network etc the challenge for io is not really so much about the many locations as the different styles of management inherent to each of those things one team   you have the traditional outsourcer you have the things that maybe you as an it organization are managing yourself which would be a little bit different than the way the outsourcer does business then you may have this completely devopsoriented way of operating in aws but your cic pipeline in aws is primarily an open source checkins pipeline and your cic pipeline in azure is a primarily azure devops pipeline so the tooling problems go beyond what is facing io per se,1/22/2020,Advice,Marketing Awareness,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1549,Lydia Leong,Project Pacific,kubernetes service fabric message testing the problems that we are seeing now go beyond things that are solvable by containers if youve seen my recent note on cloud lockin theres an entire section of that note devoted to why containers will not solve your problems,1/22/2020,Advice,Marketing Awareness,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1550,Lydia Leong,Project Pacific,kubernetes service fabric message testing the one thing i would note is that within gartner we are starting to talk about how   we have enough analysts who have essentially drunk to kubernetes koolaid  that we too often have a tendency to recommend that if you containerize things will be better for many of our clients it has turned out that when they containerize things are not better and they are in fact worse we are trying to very much step away from this notion of containers will solve your problems and to be more careful as we look at industry announcements and the impact of those industry announcements to not have that knee jerk of oh is kubernetes its good,1/22/2020,Advice,Marketing Awareness,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1551,Lydia Leong,Project Pacific,kubernetes service fabric message testing it means that there is no one universal approach to management because not everything is containerized you still have to deal with your virtual machines and everything else the issue that all of our clients are dealing with is the increased complexity of everything   the number of options that can and should realistically be pursued and so on the number of architectural decisions they have to make has increased,1/22/2020,Advice,Marketing Awareness,2019.4,FY20 Q4

1562,Ed Anderson,Project Pacific,kubernetes service fabric message testing i dont know that you need to necessarily call out vms vs containers   a little redundant likewise i dont see theres a ton of value for the compute storage network pieces underneath i guess if youre going to put me on the spot i like the simplified version that basically just layers universal service fabric management applications and business outcomes as the most straightforward and simple version of this,1/21/2020,Advice,Messaging,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1563,Ed Anderson,Project Pacific,kubernetes service fabric message testing the main point im trying to make is less about openshift or anthos its more about outlining an open framework that takes the question off the table about what i can do or cant do ultimately the only reason why the customers are returning to this whole notion of a universal service fabric is they want freedom flexibility and choice they dont want to be locked into any given environment otherwise theyd probably just go with amazon kubernetes service or azure and just forget it and try to just use those but they want an open framework that they can work in thats the message here   its open its extensible even the message about applications built using kubernetes but running it in an anthos framework or somewhere else that by nature those things are compatible and can run in this environment that kind of message is really really important if you can land that well then you become this bastion of choice and freedom rather than yet another framework to put on the list of things to evaluate,1/21/2020,Advice,Messaging,2019.4,FY20 Q4

1635,Craig Lowery,Cloud (VCPP),anyone who is in the hosting business and vcpps are categorized as hosters they are under pressure to remain relevant as their customers leave i have long thought vmwareares opportunity was in providing them with capabilities to remain relevant if the capabilities you provide them with are always based on vsphere in my opinion thats a deadend its a bit of a bridge now that you have vsphere embedded in and adjacent to the major hyperscale providers it does bring some value now because its on both sides of the bridge without that capability to go truly managing the cloud services directly those native cloud services its still a dead end,1/14/2020,Negative,Partner readiness,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1636,Craig Lowery,Cloud (VCPP),weve heard from clients that lift and shift was not the thing to do weve got to figure out whats the right way to use cloud thats going to take a lot longer because the skills are just not there they arent walking down the street msps even companies like yours have difficulty finding people with these kinds of skills that understand this new way to build applications that are more horizontally scaled that have essential consistency and the data model it requires experience and training and we are still having to ramp up in the industry to find those things,1/14/2020,Advice,Partner readiness,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1637,Craig Lowery,Cloud (VCPP),whats happening now is that realization that these lift and shift migrations are just not cutting it when you are trying to move to aws native or azure native instead customers are rethinking what their options are their ideal is that everything gets rewritten cloud native thats just not going to happen ive had some customers present with tell me who i can get to rewrite everything im thinking that you cant afford to rewrite everything and you shouldnt rewrite everything only certain things that have strategic and longterm value need to get that kind of makeover youve got to decide what to do with the other things and its probably not shoving everything into a ec2 instance,1/14/2020,Advice,Customer Related,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1638,Craig Lowery,Cloud (VCPP),if you want to get out of your own data center and shut it down and its not cost effective to modernize transform or live with the operational inefficiencies and cost overruns putting the application asis into a native hyperscaler since most everybody is on vmwareare using a vcpp solution makes a lot of sense thats one of the things we bring out thats an obvious thing to do to look for providers that can help by linking you with your presence in the hyperscale cloud,1/14/2020,Advice,Customer Related,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1639,Craig Lowery,Cloud (VCPP),i think of it like if you travel and you go to a hotel that only running water and electricity you are still fine with that because you packed everything including the bed whereas the true cloud native is i expect this to be a 5star hotel with as many amenities as possible so i travel as light as i can i only bring my clothes i dont even bring a toothbrush thats provided for me,1/14/2020,Advice,Marketing Awareness,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1640,Craig Lowery,Cloud (VCPP),there is a conflation in marketing right now in this industry thats selling the idea that containers and kubernetes are the equivalent of cloud native if you are doing containers and kubernetes then you are cloud native thats just not true they can be used for both true or inspired cloud native implementations they could also be used to put monolithic applications there too they may be portable but it doesnt make you cloud native the real value of the containers and kubernetes comes in how you use them the kind of code you put inside of hem containers dont solve the portability problem they dont keep you from locking in,1/14/2020,Advice,Marketing Awareness,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1641,Craig Lowery,Cloud (VCPP),kubernetes does create portability for orchestrations so there is a little bit of portability here in writing your autoscaling or autohealing and having that run on any cloud instead of using the native autoscaler thats actually pretty valuable when you put the two together they solve a packaging and distribution problem ,1/14/2020,Advice,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2019.4,FY20 Q4
1642,Craig Lowery,Cloud (VCPP),your developers learn one way to package stuff up regardless of which cloud it goes to it doesnt make the code portable but it makes the skills portable it makes their skills more broad and more applicable to more infrastructure destinations where you might want to deploy code the code you deploy there may use something specific in that cloud and cant work anywhere else thats okay you are getting the full value of the containers and kubernetes duo combining that with the pieces inside of public cloud that you really find the most value in,1/14/2020,Advice,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2019.4,FY20 Q4
1643,Craig Lowery,Cloud (VCPP),our guidance to enduser clients is dont just lock in to lock in when you use one of these true cloud native services you need to have a good reason for it because its delivering value that you cant get anywhere else its the bestofbreed service if you can get by without using that cloudnative service and its not going to introduce a lot of inefficiencies or overhead then you should consider using something more portable if you anticipate the need to move in the future that would be a business justification i think the most potent business justification for writing containers to avoid lockin isnt because i may need to move from one cloud to another someday its because i need the same code to run in multiple cloud simultaneously,1/14/2020,Advice,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2019.4,FY20 Q4
1644,Craig Lowery,Cloud (VCPP),customers are not going to tell the vcpp partner theyre going to tell the msps i know for a fact that nearly everybody that we talk to is trying to follow the cloudnative path they wouldnt go to a vcpp partner and thats part of the challenges with the vcpp partner program is that it doesnt have a component like this i dont think vcpp customers look at the vcpp partner as a cloudnative solution provider they know its vmwareare,1/14/2020,Advice,Partner readiness,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1645,Craig Lowery,Cloud (VCPP),they know that it doesnt have aws capabilities or azure capabilities but those things are only available in those clouds so they go to an msp like you can find in the mq now some of those are vcpps they do have a vmwareare solution that they can host and those actually become very attractive to customers that want to maintain their vmware footprint and use an msp that can provide them with multicloud and hybrid cloud solutions as well as cloudnative tooling to help them make that move thats another reason why the vmc and all of the variants that we see on the other clouds is ultimate youll see a threat to the vcpp partner network because it provides that proximity to true hyperscale cloudnative solutions that proximity is really important ,1/14/2020,Advice,Partner readiness,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1646,Craig Lowery,Cloud (VCPP),the desire is to put everything into a hyperscale cloud and be in one place and ideally in only one cloud thats a pipe dream its not going to happen we gartner have to tell customers thats a great strategy nice wish but its not possible you dont have the skills or the money to rewrite everything you are going to be in multiple clouds whether you like it or not hybrid and multicloud are in your future or they are already there most of our clients think they have a choice when i talk to them about it they realize they already made the choice,1/14/2020,Advice,Adoption,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1647,Craig Lowery,Cloud (VCPP),if its a vcpp partner taking over vmwareare stuff that suits that need but only temporarily it is not going to be a growth business after that initial migration its going to be a slow trickle away the same thing is true for vmware cloud on aws all of our clients tell us its a weigh point the vcpp partners are also considered a weigh point in most cloud strategies they do have a function to serve for the immediate future,1/14/2020,Neutral,Partner readiness,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1648,Craig Lowery,Cloud (VCPP),the thing about outposts is that its not a private cloud people think it is when they use it they realize its another availability zone in the region if you lose connectivity you better get it back in six hours or it stops working those limitations arent fully understood ,1/14/2020,Advice,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2019.4,FY20 Q4
1649,Craig Lowery,Cloud (VCPP),there may be a lot of talk from customers about those like outposts solutions and the vcpp solution coming on prem and deploying something that is more autonomous because those solutions are not autonomous that will resonate with customers for some time   the ones that cant get out of their data centers even if they had wanted to stay certainly it resonates with them but even the ones who want to move but just cant being able to continue with managed services on prem  and getting some more cloudnativetype solutions on prem  could be useful to them ,1/14/2020,Advice,Customer Related,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1650,Craig Lowery,Cloud (VCPP),as long as the work they do to become cloud native is transferrable to the public cloud tanzu has some value prop there once i write it i can run it anywhere,1/14/2020,Positive,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2019.4,FY20 Q4
1651,Craig Lowery,Cloud (VCPP),you have all of the tools and pieces and youve been building this out youve got a fragmented platform with project path i see you proposing to unify those three roles into a single platform many of your providers are all three of those or 2 out of the 3 it makes their life much more easier and makes your life much more valuable to them it cements your relationship a little more tighter so i absolutely agree with this,1/14/2020,Positive,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2019.4,FY20 Q4
1652,Craig Lowery,Cloud (VCPP),this is the natural evolution of what you are doing and brings a lot of value and simplification and aggregation into a single platform the difficulty with it is going to be the details of the implementation for all of the three different roles that you have here and then all of the clouds underneath them that will be the challenge building something that you can maintain sustaining engineering as well as evolve with new features and enhancements it will be critical to get the architecture on it right that would be my only concern,1/14/2020,Positive,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2019.4,FY20 Q4
1653,Craig Lowery,Cloud (VCPP),the main value that project path path would provide uniformity standardization low friction prescribed ways to do things with not a lot of value of doing things in differentiation differentiation is going to come more from professional services most of the money that cloud providers and msps especially comes from professional services which is vended as a consumable service too thats flexible with an open contract and project scopes can change without opening contract   thats where they are innovating ,1/14/2020,Advice,Messaging,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1654,Craig Lowery,Cloud (VCPP),this makes total sense to me project path path is the simplification unification of all of these things so that theres a onestop shop for a provider to go to get that stuff and get it quickly and get it done then they can focus on these higher order value propositions they have to get right in order for them to survive thats the narrative you should be telling,1/14/2020,Positive,Messaging,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1655,Craig Lowery,Cloud (VCPP),i like the idea that you are leveraging existing integration vectors to give your partners the ability to reuse some of the things already done for vcd or vrealize or for other products i think you need a simple way to implement that should be a basic thing having an alternative instead of going through a legacy integration pattern a simple rest api pattern easy to navigate as possible will keep it simple,1/14/2020,Positive,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2019.4,FY20 Q4
1656,Craig Lowery,Cloud (VCPP),im really pleased with what youve shown me the things you said aligned very closely i dont see any big misalignments i see small tweaks it really comes down to your slide   its a new day things are changing a new wind is blowing something like that i think that might be stronger than even you realize and what your partners realize,1/14/2020,Positive,Messaging,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1657,Craig Lowery,Cloud (VCPP),they arent in the mainstream seeing how fast customers are making this transition or how much desire they have they see it but are their customers leaving and not saying anything or saying something and then leaving when they dont like what they hear they understand that its happening i think vmwareare has been slow to respond to this or to acknowledge it it has happened more recently that i finally see them picking up speed and hopefully its not too late,1/14/2020,Advice,Customer Related,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1658,Craig Lowery,Cloud (VCPP),i think you are at the low end of really solving the problem that the partners are going to have you are understanding it but you are going to have to go farther youre going to have to be more aggressive in how you help them incorporate management for all of these other cloud providers that are not vspherebased,1/14/2020,Advice,Partnerships,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1659,Craig Lowery,Cloud (VCPP),my biggest gripe with vmwareare   every time we have these discussions around multicloud management  especially in the marketing materials  is that its all about vsphere its still all about vsphere what you are showing me with path and the pieces you are bringing in through the saas pieces for the cloud operations  you are saying the right things and youve got pieces that can do what is necessary,1/14/2020,Advice,Marketing Awareness,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1660,Craig Lowery,Cloud (VCPP),my concern is youre going to build this and youre not going to market it right put it out the door and people are going to be timid about making statements that pat might not like i told pat that we are coming to the end of vms we are moving into a world where vms are not important top of mind things containers are a little bit more but it really even goes beyond that its about the developer and about the things that they want and the commercial offtheshelf stuff thats running on vmwareare today   thats moving to saas over time pat didnt like that but i still believe it,1/14/2020,Advice,Marketing Awareness,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1661,Craig Lowery,Cloud (VCPP),your mutual customers with your vcpp partners are a little slower than some others that are making this move you are seeing the end of the train towards being in the public cloud on the hyperscalers using all of this cool and innovative technology as soon as they understand it they are going to grab for it youve got the right pieces in place and youre saying the right things to me the concern is youre not going to go out the door with this strong sentiment and youre going to miss opportunities because customers wont hear you talking about what they want to hear,1/14/2020,Advice,Marketing Awareness,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1662,Craig Lowery,Cloud (VCPP),that would be my final advice its not of a technical nature but its of a gotomarket nature vmwareare has to be unafraid to get its hand out of the cookie jar dell has this problem of we cant threaten our existing revenue streams by talking about new things because customers will stop buying what weve got,1/14/2020,Advice,Partnerships/Dell,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1663,Craig Lowery,Cloud (VCPP),its going to happen no matter what you say its more important that you align with the trends and show you are a leader youve got the technology youve got people on this call that get it the concern will be after you deliver how is the company going to talk about it compared to the other things that it does thats my final guidance,1/14/2020,Advice,Marketing Awareness,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1664,Jennifer Clark,Uhana,jennifer is interested in the adoption of cnfs or cloudbased container core from carriers and how it will change with fiveg fivegjenn is also interested in fiveg 5g deployments and also examples of how vmwareare works with enterprises like utilities or large manufacturing companies,1/14/2020,Neutral,Adoption,2019.4,FY20 Q4

1666,Jennifer Clark,Uhana,this builds on vmwareares expertise of starting with the hypervisors and working up into the vnfs this certainly makes sense with the rest of your portfoliojennifer was positive on the fact that uhana does not require any special hardware to operate,1/14/2020,Positive,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2019.4,FY20 Q4
1667,Jennifer Clark,Uhana,vmwareare has an opportunity over other performance monitoring tools that only gather information in 15 minute increments because they will miss spikes and lulls within those incrementsshe validated the value uhana provides in getting the information more frequently,1/14/2020,Positive,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2019.4,FY20 Q4
1668,Craig Lowery,VMC on AWS,the vmwareare cloud on aws offering in the same vein obviously solves that problem its one of the things i recommend frequently especially to government agencies because theyre under the gun from the executive branch just to get to cloud do it i had a conversation with an agency in the dod recently for example who is typical of this conversation ive had many like it theres a conference room with 20 people around the camera and im in the camera looking at all of them we need the fastest way to get out of our data center and into aws the general expects us to do this in a month im shaking my head my answer to them is vmware cloud on aws thats the solution for this but you realize that at some point you will have to come back and revisit it because you are not modernizing you are taking advantage of like for like infrastructure and this is a temporary fix,1/14/2020,Advice,Customer Related,2019.4,FY20 Q4

1789,Andrew Lerner,Networking,multicloud  a lot of promise dont see a lot of interest in adoption or free budget for it think this whole notion of multi cloud is going to ultimately be a gap filler when we start to virtualize things you buy your own networking stack networking influence went to the vswitch and even though it wasnt managed by the networking team per se you carved out a piece of networking and it never really got back people tried and there was some success here and there but for the most part it stayed where it was multicloud while it does optimize things from a networking perspective i wonder and really question if there will ever be widespread adoption of the notion of having a unified pane of glass whether the workload is on amazon or azure onprem from a networking perspective that rules all my prediction is the winner will be whoevers got the lightest weight stack im not convinced thats a new product category i believe that that is an adjacent category to the data center cloud networking or to sd wan i think that that is essentially a feature of that of those broader markets versus an independent dedicated product ,12/19/2019,Neutral,Messaging,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1790,Andrew Lerner,Networking,market share  forecast  the way gartner tracks the broader market and vmwareare gartner tracks switching revenue and tracks nsx kind of in some other random category over here and felt it didnt adequately reflect the market now adding software licensing for all switching including data center switching  so instead of us just saying here is switching stats and ports revenue and port speed were going to say here is software licensing as well whether that is a naas whether that is a subscription license we still have that to do that from a normalization perspective but at least were going to start measuring forecasting and doing market share for software licenses,12/19/2019,Neutral,Marketing Awareness,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1791,Andrew Lerner,Networking,on day2 operations  youre the only company that really has this capability over the top to be consumed as a service because the general market isnt aware of it thats a huge differentiating capability because building these systems and feeding them the right data is really challenging i agree with is that when you shift products and focus here you do broaden the audience of these tools i think your vision of everything app down is ahead of where most of the market can take to get to right now,12/19/2019,Positive,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2019.4,FY20 Q4
1792,Andrew Lerner,Networking,i remember the transition v to t  it was painful multiple layers and what you tell us that its a flagship matches what we see from inquiry you guys actually did a pretty darn good job of turning that battleship quickly versus some competitors who it takes them longer theres what we call channel latency but definitely recognize nsx t as the go forward lead theres a lot of v out there and theres instances where v makes sense but we see you leading with t most of the time so that matches what you are telling us,12/19/2019,Positive,Adoption,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1793,Andrew Lerner,Networking,comment on the cisco api issue   aware of using the api incorrectly because we have to actually figure out how to score this at some point in the past my assessment of this is that this is not a pervasive and this is not impacting larger numbers of customers this is a very small number  less than a handful of customers are actually having this issue pervasively thats my thats my take the way youre talking about it is having me question it and that you guys think this is a much more pervasive and largescale issue,12/19/2019,Neutral,Competitive mentions/intel,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1794,Andrew Lerner,Networking,nsx cloud your vision which is bringing amazon like experience on prem in absolutely aligns with what youre telling me the really big challenge of the amazon experience is the ui and the actual end user experience of not seeing a stack of components and i dont think youre there yet i think the end user still sees too many skews even if theyre in ela that again ties in with the go to market and how you actually deliver it but its a new buying center too your strategy is very aspirational and large swaths of the market are not going to be ready for it in the next five years but thats okay its good to have aspirations my only concern is that for the portion of the market that wont be ready for it for the five years you still have to sell to those customers and thats in many ways is going to be counter to the vision and thats going to be the technical debt differentiate on naming nsx cloud  nsx cloud lightweight ,12/19/2019,Positive,Messaging,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1795,Andrew Lerner,Networking,federation i feel like this isnt as pervasive a need as your positioning it as valuable it sounds like youve added some capabilities in v at least recently this used to come up all the time but it doesnt come up that much now because theres clearly value that youre driving into the market here especially for new customers with multiple sites i fear that because this is so hard to engineer youre overemphasizing the value to customers as this is a nice to have i think youre overestimating the customer sentiment around how valuable this is because of how hard it was to engineer,12/19/2019,Neutral,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2019.4,FY20 Q4
1796,Andrew Lerner,Networking,i would say nsx is the most complete stack in a microservices environment if youre going to micro services if youre dabbling in it you have to come to vmwareare nobody else can put this together  cisco cant do this istio nginx and f5 can give you their piece but were the only one up and down the stack this is a broader networking message that should and will resonate with the networking team because it gets away from the notion of complexity and heterogeneity,12/19/2019,Positive,Messaging,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1797,Andrew Lerner,Networking,vrni its being dramatically undersold and undermarketed to traditional networking teams get the long term vision of if youre going to bring an amazon like experience that you dont have to worry about this boring little technical detail that is the network because its just going to be abstracted away youre never going to touch it but in the interim till we get there theres a long tail of stuff we can add in and i think vrni and vrni as a service is more compelling to traditional network teams than nsx is its nsx versus aci whether you like it or not and if you shift the conversation of vrni vrni versus tetration nirnia prime dcnm  and that gets really ugly really quickly the fact that you deliver this as a service which is completely unique in the market at this point and it has broader functionality that you market to me its extremely undersold under represented now and until you get to where youre actually delivering the full amazon on prem and people are subscribed to it,12/19/2019,Positive,Messaging,2019.4,FY20 Q4
1798,Andrew Lerner,Project Pacific,project pacific the people who are doing this today on prem are networking people and they have their kubernetes people and someway somehow they get a hold of either a cni from their network people or they go and they download and then they kind of work together and install it and they basically make it so that this thing can talk to the pod or the cluster and they get some kind of basic rudimentary information and theres a lot of elbow grease and manual work essentially what youve done is youve abstracted all that away you dont have to have the conversation with the network guys it just sets everything up at least in the software layer above the physical network,12/19/2019,Positive,Messaging,2019.4,FY20 Q4

2000,Michael Warrilow,VMC,market trends contrasting the many vmwareare cloud offerings  the emergence of an increased range of vmwarebased service offerings comes at a time when many enterprises are moving to embrace even greater proportions of operational expenditure rather than capital expenditure further many enterprises are considering the possibility of consolidating their onpremises data center infrastructure in favor of colocation hosting managed services and cloud these drivers are in addition to improved access to increased levels of agility and innovation from leading public cloud providers finally both public cloud and now hardware providers offer consumptionbased pricing given these factors the emergence of an increased range of vmwarebased service offerings is important to a wide range of technology and service providers,11/20/2019,Neutral,Adoption,2019.4,FY20 Q4

2156,Craig Lawson,Security,you know theres still billions of lines of idps out there and theyre in there is 10s of millions of idps sigs that have been custom developed for very specific use cases for very specific applications for very specific end user organizations and theyre not getting off i wouldnt hide the fact of what youve got and the interoperability with compatible regular expression logic as a lot of people have been invested in that and so thats going to let you leverage all of their existing intellectual property but roll that out in this different form factor,10/21/2019,Neutral,Messaging,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2157,Craig Lawson,Security,at this point mcafee and tipping points ips is fundamentally different   its a fundamentally different engine under the bonnet and they have all front ended it with a pcre engine and the reason why is that people have their own intellectual property they want to run around content but anyone that graduates the same course in network security what are they going to learn theyre going to learn more pcre engine rules and so idps rules today still is one of the only security technologies that regularly has end users write their own security content,10/21/2019,Neutral,Messaging,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2158,Craig Lawson,Security,we still have a lot of people running ids   it never went away one of the one of the big innovations in idps isnt the engine so id recommend having a look at that as well because like suricata and store pcre rules theres a lot of logic kicking around at the brow that people use thats worth considering but the magic is in how they postprocess the event not in how they collect the telemetry if any security technology was purpose built to be used for machine learning its ids ips and edr,10/21/2019,Neutral,Messaging,2019.3,FY20 Q3

2219,Lawrence Orans,Networking,this moving security to the cloud instead of buying physical appliances and putting them in that data center is definitely the trend that were seeing in the market i think the challenge for vmwareare is going to be to prove that your internally developed firewalls and idps are as good as riptali pa networks and then menlo and netscope theyre both new to the proxy game so you might have some skepticism there but i think the overall concept makes a lot of sense to move these traditional perimeter security appliances and move that security stack up into the cloud this is definitely where we see the market going,10/14/2019,Neutral,Messaging,2019.3,FY20 Q3

2221,Lawrence Orans,Networking,on an integrated package versus im going to pull together myself approach i dont think customers have had to make that choice so far right theyre getting the sdwan from vendor a and the cloud security stack from vendor b but i think maybe the larger customers may want to have best breed they may want to stick with their cloud security provider and maybe they would go with velocloud still for sdwan in the midmarket i think youll find greater reception to the single integrated story thats how its going to play out,10/14/2019,Neutral,Messaging,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2222,Lawrence Orans,Networking,i think another challenge that you will have with hundreds of pops with this cloud architecture is that you have to prove that you have the operational experience in maturity to keep this thing up and running you mentioned that a lot of this is built on velocloud and thats a proven technology but still its new for vmwareare and adding more services into the cloud and because you cant buy software off the shelf to help you manage the cloud and see the scalability all those operational issues i think you have to prove that,10/14/2019,Neutral,Messaging,2019.3,FY20 Q3

2248,Stephen O'Grady,Pivotal,the opportunity for vmwareare is the same that ibm is going after with redhat how ibm is handling the redhat acquisition ibm is putting a firewall between the organizations you dont have ibm people coming in and talking to redhat people they have different people talking to different audiences,10/8/2019,Neutral,Competitive mentions/intel,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2249,KellyAnne Fitzpatrick,Pivotal,regarding plans for pivotals events once they are part of vmwareare there is a tendency is to think larger events are better the developers ive talked to say the big events exhausting and they dont get to talk to each other it is qualitatively a better events experience when theres a single track many events start developercentric but then they evolve and developers leave understand the job to be done its more about content and communitybuilding,10/8/2019,Advice,Strategy,2019.3,FY20 Q3

2258,Craig Lowery,Pivotal,my biggest concern for vmwareare you are still ignoring the power of aws there are adoption patterns for cloud native that look nothing like containers and cncf cncf is taking containers and trying to say this is the cloud native story it is a cloud nativeinspired way to use infrastructure but what i saw today that gets it is azure spring cloud the integrations are there and it was the most significant thing revealed at springone because it shows spring as becoming something valuable outside of the pas context that has to happen for pivotal to get more of those stakeholders who arent willing to pay for pas,10/8/2019,Positive,Strategy,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2259,Mike Dorosh,Pivotal,the pivotal labs experience more valuable than the platform it breaks the paradigm of the culture deals with all sides of the culture dont screw up the lab in fact replicate the lab across all parts of your businessi would argue that 5 years from now pivotals technology will be less relevant than the impact of community,10/8/2019,Positive,Strategy,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2260,Craig Lowery,Pivotal,pivotal labs will give you credibility you need to figure out how to scale it ive known msps who use partnership with pivotal to get pivotal labs and those who try to mimic it they say the value is in getting out of your onprem infrastructure mindset and think about more dynamic solutions and enabling devops culture,10/8/2019,Positive,Strategy,2019.3,FY20 Q3

2263,Craig Lowery,Pivotal,have an opinionated approach but allow for some latitude this is how we do it can sell take more of that story into pivotal labs scaling into india would take some thought have to be credible there may be a way to augment the labs experience so that it can be done more distrubuted virtual or even leverage some of the more modern collaborative technologies to get it to scale,10/8/2019,Advice,Strategy,2019.3,FY20 Q3

2270,Mike Dorosh,Tanzu,your part of the story tanzu has been told well now we need to hear the concrete things vmwareare is doing to operationalize whereas looking at anthos stuff coming out of google it is lots of hype every client service provider i talk to wants to know what tanzu will look like it is more clear to them what it will look like than anthos is,10/8/2019,Positive,Competitive mentions/intel,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2271,Craig Lowery,Tanzu,pat says we need to court the developers our advice is not necessarily to court the developers our advice is to court the business owners who hire those developers and choose the platforms they will develop on not developers themselves some get to choose some dont those who own the apps get to choose,10/8/2019,Advice,Messaging,2019.3,FY20 Q3

2273,Craig Lowery,Tanzu,how will he judge the success of the acquisition in a year or two i would like to see that pivotal comes up in more discussions hearing about the technologies in more inquiries aws is in tons of inquiries and its not always about infrastructure i want to know how to use lambda i want to know how to determine which applications are really wellsuited for a cloud makeover that platform is so inserted into the transformation discussion that you cant get away from talking about aws if i hear vmwareare and pivotal in more of those discussions it will be a success i hear pivotal occasionally but its generally a negative gosh its expensive great but expensive thats usually what i hear,10/8/2019,Neutral,Competitive mentions/intel,2019.3,FY20 Q3

2286,Jeffrey Hammond,Containers/PKS,interesting from forresters perspective is how different enterprise vendors are trying to create lockin new cloud packs that ibm has launched are tied to openshift if you want to run one of those packs you have to run it on openshift it seems like an arbitrary dependency ties you to open shift doesnt make sense for clients but for ibm it does will be interesting to see how that strategy survives extended contact with customers,10/7/2019,Neutral,Competitive mentions/intel,2019.3,FY20 Q3

2478,Julia Palmer,HCI/vSAN,i liked john gilmartins keynote   his take on futureproofing infrastructure and i noted his mention of composable infrastructure that was kind of cool i look at composable as a building block for hardware  building bare metal servershpe is calling programmable composable and intelligent composable which is incorrect theyre trying to break in their message of the stack but it misses the marki would like to talk to vmwareare customers that have consistent infrastructure across different deployment optionsjulia also wants to hear more about how vmware will do more at the orchestrationapplication layerhyperconverged infrastructure at the edge  we havent heard enough about what vmware and other vendors are doing with itvmware should create a 35 year scenario  how will solutions be used and how will vmware get customers therejulia wants an update on aws outpostsid also like to see one big diagram of what vcf can be onprem or the edge and how it will map to the public cloud and what hardware options you can have on the bottom of the diagram so you show how it all fits together,9/11/2019,Positive,Strategy,2019.3,FY20 Q3

2481,Phil Dawson,HCI/vSAN,the hci mq will be primarily focused on storage features vmwareares other features are rich and unique and if gartner required the full stack in the mq then only vmware would be eligible the downside of this is that vmware will likely not be moving to the right on vision based on our lack of progress filling any of the previously exposed gaps in storage services storage efficiencies for hybrid file system object system and snapshots,9/9/2019,Neutral,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2019.3,FY20 Q3

2483,Anne Thomas,Containers/PKS,pks is not high on the short list for lots of orgs looking at doing kubernetes if they were not a previous pivotal customer no question redhat dominates that conversation there is some discussion about vmwareare but more often rancher openshift gke aks eks conversations tend to be about the more popular kubernetes platforms pks comes into play if vmware is involved in the conversation a year or so ago vmware was talking to their customers and i got lots of questions recently i havent had as many questions about containers and pks more about openshift,9/5/2019,Neutral,Competitive mentions/intel,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2484,Anne Thomas,Containers/PKS,we get a ton of questions about containers that dont talk about specific products should we even bring them in whats the business case how much will we save from a density perspective how many to have running in a particular vm lots of survey material relative to the adoption of containers,9/5/2019,Neutral,Customer Related,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2485,Anne Thomas,Containers/PKS,generally questions come from the ops teams developers just start using containers the four companies we hear about for onprem kubernetes are redhat rancher pivotal and vmwareare,9/5/2019,Neutral,Customer Related,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2486,Anne Thomas,Containers/PKS,asked if kubernetes is inevitable she said kubernetes is pretty much a given in the industry at this point its not a question of if but when they will go to kubernetes ive seen a combo of containers and vms micro vms never assume a certain technology is forever,9/5/2019,Neutral,Marketing Awareness,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2487,Anne Thomas,Containers/PKS,multicloud is definitely an appealing message but shortterm the other choice is to put all your eggs in one basket people want the ability to move workloads back and forth between two environments therefore using a multicloud administrative environment we can move stuff around the downside of multicloud is you dont get to take advantage of a vast number of services available from different providers because you have to take the least common denominator approach how important is portability really do we actually anticipate bursting workloads from one cloud to another will i exploit attractive capabilities less for the sake of portability multicloud will resonate for many for some number of years as things move toward more serverless that value prop will fade multicloud is a shortterm strategy,9/5/2019,Neutral,Strategy,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2488,Anne Thomas,Containers/PKS,as soon as i start using gke or aws or azure services they are no longer portable the least common denominator is my multicloud stack,9/5/2019,Neutral,Customer Related,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2489,Anne Thomas,Containers/PKS,you have a 23 year runway where multicloud retains its value i think its already starting to fade with things like anthos and if outposts ever happens i do know some customers who use multiple clouds but most have picked one,9/5/2019,Neutral,Strategy,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2490,Anne Thomas,Containers/PKS,ive been talking about iaas and paas merger with paas svcs on top of iaas thats what locks you in youre building your apps and relying on these services it seems like if youre really concerned about whether microsoft or amazon or google will go away it makes sense to worry separate divisions may also choose their own clouds but a particular division is typically primarily using one not multiple clouds,9/5/2019,Neutral,Customer Related,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2491,Anne Thomas,Containers/PKS,hybrid appeals to many organizations same platform on prem and in a hosted managed world is hosted and managed for me i get the full native use resonates with many clients undermines multicloud hybrid cloud is whats undermining the multicloud discussion the multicloud model is more common than hybrid but they dont like it as much people are intrigued by outposts and anthos,9/5/2019,Neutral,Customer Related,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2492,Anne Thomas,Containers/PKS,vmwareare was not making headway into the developer world and that is absolutely pivotals strong suit how do we convince developers that vmware is more than system virtualization,9/5/2019,Negative,Strategy,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2493,Anne Thomas,Containers/PKS,when i get briefed by vmwareare 30 goes right over my head as they speak to ops and i dont i think thats a really significant concern thats why developers dont take vmware as having any relevance in their world weve had this traditional divide between dev and ops devops attempts to solve that but even with devops you have dev and ops speaking two very different languages with very different concerns priorities and imperatives,9/5/2019,Negative,Messaging,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2494,Anne Thomas,Containers/PKS,the opinion of vmwareare with developers is neutral not negative because most devs understand that their systems get deployed into virtual machines the negative opinion is that the ops world doesnt understand devs concerns or the needs of developers and theyre too concerned with cost and security and not letting developers do what they need to do,9/5/2019,Neutral,Customer Related,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2495,Anne Thomas,Containers/PKS,vmwareare doesnt speak dev the senior management at vmware doesnt understand the dev audience and they dont give it equal weight so how does vmware start to appeal to the developer audience they need a corporate message aimed at a dev audience dont just speak in terms of ops issues but speak to devrelated issues also vmware needs to become true devops say were all about bridging the divide between developers and operators and want to make life better for both the dev org is about deadlines but more and more dev orgs are focused on code increasing revenue or winning customers with this new feature everyone will love or simplifying a process how do we take time and money out of this critical process vmware may be in a good position now to do so,9/5/2019,Negative,Messaging,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2496,Anne Thomas,Containers/PKS,how does io become a business value generator as opposed to a cost centerit would be good if you got pat to speak that language because it needs to come from the top you need a cultural change within vmwareare we are moving into the dev space and need to be able to talk to the apps leader and not just to the ops or cio but the apps org and have to be able to speak to those issues and if pat doesnt know what those issues are and continues to talk just to the ops audience its not good this really has to come from the top,9/5/2019,Advice,Messaging,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2497,Anne Thomas,Containers/PKS,we produce a lot of content for the ops organization which is you need to stop using the command and control model and work more with the enablement model less about command and control,9/5/2019,Neutral,Messaging,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2498,Anne Thomas,Containers/PKS,this is why developers love serverless because they refer to it as a no ops experience because you dont need operators involved at all when youre doing that developers are just packaging their code and deploying it developers love it because you dont have to deal with operations anymore,9/5/2019,Neutral,Customer Related,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2499,Anne Thomas,Containers/PKS,the dev org loves the term platform ops as it means this is my selfservice platform ive got a team dedicated to assuring that my selfservice platform is working if vmwareare becomes the platform ops company and vmware as a whole really starts promoting the idea that we are going to help you move from being the stodgy old ops org into one that is fully embracing everything  that is awesome about infrastructure as code and immutable infrastructure and selfservice platform and all that other stuff  if vmware talks about moving ops into the 21st century and becoming stateoftheart orgs that are critical to the digital business transformation and enabling the kinds of agility that the business needs thats the message vmware needs to adopt you will become the proprietors of this awesome selfservice fully automated selfhealing platform environment that is easy for you to manage and maintain it has the security controls you need it has all kinds of resiliency built into it this is going to be the next gen platform and vmware and certainaly tanzu and pacific i think have the potential to make that happen,9/5/2019,Advice,Strategy,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2500,Anne Thomas,Containers/PKS,pivotal has stuff built on top of that selfservice platform like the selfhealing application infrastructure and tools that go with it there also has to be the legacy modernization story that goes along with that there are many legacy systems that are in no position to move to this new platform thats another place where pivotal labs comes into play pivotal labs now becomes the training program,9/5/2019,Advice,Strategy,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2501,Anne Thomas,Containers/PKS,amazon sound cloud and spotify are the orgs that said were fundamentally changing not just dev but also ops and creating a very very different way of delivering products vmwareare which is thorougly steeped in the world of ops probably doesnt believe this message yet and you pivotal need to change that because if vmware doesnt believe this message theres no way they can convey it to customers,9/5/2019,Neutral,Strategy,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2502,Anne Thomas,Containers/PKS,vmwareare recognizes that vms are not the beall and endall and in fact are old tech and that containers and serverless are where the future lies weve been talking about this for 5 years i applaud them for saying we are fully embracing kubernetes and making it a core piece of vsphere we are evolving vsphere to not just be vms but to be a full container management environment if pacific works the way they are planning they have a huge opportunity to own container management because it becomes part of the extended os world as opposed to a piece of middleware i put on top of my os,9/5/2019,Positive,Strategy,2019.3,FY20 Q3

2509,Anne Thomas,Pivotal,the tooling pivotal has around pas is going to make kubernetes a much more interesting platform anne assumes vmwareare will make kubernetes part of the compute fabric then the tooling makes that happen she didnt think pivotal could survive just as a separate tooling company but thinks that could now be pivotals role vmware would be  responsible for the infrastructure pivotal becomes the build arm focusing on having the best tooling around for building awesome applications which can be deployed onto the compute fabric regardless of where that is and regardless of whether we are putting these into vms or super lightweight vms or containers then we fully provide the pathway for stateful processes to work inside that fabric,9/5/2019,Positive,Strategy,2019.3,FY20 Q3

2512,Anne Thomas,Project Pacific,talked to a customer who was talking about micro vms as a better way of supporting stateful apps than containers they think containers are awesome but not the most appropriate compute fabric for all workloads vmwareare could make project pacific that universal compute fabric which supports different types of compute systems with different types of workloads and makes it simple to put this nondistributed data store into this environment and let pacific figure out how to manage it pacific would put that into a vm whether a big vm a little vm or a micro vm if vmware has a model which gives you the same benefits you get from the container system but from a lightweight vm instead and this universal compute fabric makes it all look and feel the same it may be 4 or 5 years out but its a great goal,9/5/2019,Neutral,Customer Related,2019.3,FY20 Q3

2617,Mike Dorosh,VMC on AWS,when you first announced vmc on aws we had more people who were asking about when is this going to be on azure than asking about the vmc on aws service now its flipped because of the marketing,8/27/2019,Positive,Competitive mentions/intel,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2618,Mike Dorosh,VMC on AWS,a lot of people in the analyst community not in the cloud spectrum are now seeing that this is real vmc on aws for example the thing i think most people are talking about the ads to cloudhealth  secure and back into the environment that was one of the aha moments,8/27/2019,Positive,Marketing Awareness,2019.3,FY20 Q3

2623,Dave Johnson,Workspace ONE,regarding intelligent hubvirtual assistant  company called motive did this years ago and didnt work because no cloud no intelligence built in  past years at altris did this but no intelligence  in todays era it would be a big differentiator and something it would love  make sure you check ip out there so that you dont step on it ,8/27/2019,Advice,Strategy,2019.3,FY20 Q3

2627,Raul Castanon-Martinez,Workspace ONE,workspace one is the first digital workspace platform to integrate an aienabled virtual assistant digital assistant furthermore it is one of the few that supports both text and voice queries the new assistant shows an evolution in terms of bringing together different assets while at times the product updates that led to this announcement may have appeared to be largely focused on the it side of the equation the new assistant reflects how vmwareare is looking to strike a balance with the end user and the digital employee experience,8/27/2019,Positive,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2019.3,FY20 Q3
2628,James Staten,Edge,interested in the nvidia partnership in terms of working with them for edge use cases he also raised the prospect of vmwareare working with cdns who are adding edge workloads to their roadmaps or is in process of offering it,8/26/2019,Neutral,VMworld,2019.3,FY20 Q3

2632,Scott Crawford,Carbon Black,vmwareares latest reach for carbon black is a strong signal regarding its security intentions but for many its still puzzling with the advance of the hyperscalers vmware does not have the place in the sun it once had when virtualization in the enterprise led the pack of new it but on a tactical level this move makes sense carbon black can be used to deliver visibility and protection across a wide swath of terrain on traditional endpoints as well as in the cloud and more this visibility is even more valuable with attacks that penetrate defenses and encrypted communications obscuring much that can only be evident at endpoints  to succeed vmware will have to be focused more squarely on competitors in a security market where the dynamics are often quite different from more familiar territory not exactly home turf,8/23/2019,Neutral,Strategy,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2633,Pam Miller,All Products,pam provided a quote for the partner connect presentation the secret sauce of vmwareares partner connect is its simplicity   its easy and intuitive while still allowing a partner to differentiate and define how they choose to engage and where and how they want to invest in both vmware and their own extensions to vmware products and services,8/23/2019,Positive,Partner readiness,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2634,Kevin Rhone,All Products,kevins quote for partner connect presentation vmwareare is innovating again   moving to a new program structure that breaks barriers looking beyond simple revenue in order to recognize a partners ability to deliver real customer value the new valuebased points strategy will be a game changer one that rewards and empowers partner leaders to balance their focus and investments across business models and markets  and to take advantage of the power of emerging high value products most importantly simplicity is built into the program giving partners the ability to adjustadapt their strategies quickly to changing business conditions,8/23/2019,Positive,Partner readiness,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2635,Josh Zelonis,Carbon Black,the acquisition of carbon black by vmwareare was a bit of a surprise to me but once put into perspective it makes sense first a few observations from a value perspective carbon black brings a strong brand and technology that warranted a leader position in my last forrester wave on the endpoint detection and response edr space meanwhile the company has been suffering as a public entity with a stock price that has spent most of this year in the teens vmware is paying a premium on the stock price at 26 but is arguably getting a product worth more than what it is paying    thats what theyre betting at least,8/23/2019,Neutral,Strategy,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2636,Dave Bartoletti,Pivotal,project pacific prebriefing was consistent with messaging from vmwareare you start with saying its all about applications and building modern apps and what do we have for that weve added kubernetes to vsphere the message jumps directly from the top to the bottom developers go well thats not what i need i need pivotal i need a development platform i need a way to build software better,8/22/2019,Advice,Strategy,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2637,Dave Bartoletti,Pivotal,it the acquisition does complete that picture it will be cleaner in the market because people wonder why vmwareare builds kubernetesrelated products that seem to compete with or jump around pivotal so if theyre part of the same team then its one story on how to build modern apps and when they get to the question of where am i going to build them on a vsphere platform build my own platform in the public cloud take vsphere to the public cloud they are not saying give me kubernetes theyre saying help me build software,8/22/2019,Advice,Strategy,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2638,Jeffrey Hammond,Pivotal,one of the things that differentiates this pivotal acquisition from something like red hat and ibm is red hats got some very good kubernetes capabilities built into open shift but i dont think theres a whole lot of love for them from the developer perspective certainly from a tooling perspective and when you look at the potential to give developers tools that let them do valuable things and manage the complexity of a kubernetes infrastructure there is some real potential in the directions that pas and pfs are going,8/22/2019,Advice,Strategy,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2639,Jeffrey Hammond,Pivotal,my one feedback point dont throw the baby out with the bathwater just because you want to focus on kubernetes because thats what everybody thinks they want right now as opposed to what theyre going to actually need,8/22/2019,Advice,Strategy,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2640,Dave Bartoletti,Pivotal,our consolidated feedback is to avoid over rotating on the secret to modern apps being inserting another layer in your data center like the one you did 15 years ago this time its called kubernetes and youre going to get it from us,8/22/2019,Advice,Messaging,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2641,Dave Bartoletti,Pivotal,the way to transform modern apps is a whole ten slides before you get to that which is what pivotal does the reality in this market is that kubernetes is available everywhere the message lands very clearly that vmwareare had to have this you need to explain why this benefits customers not vmware,8/22/2019,Advice,Messaging,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2642,Peter Firstbrook,Carbon Black,carbon black  marketing is confusing  too many products   not sure how they all fit together,8/22/2019,Negative,Messaging,2019.3,FY20 Q3

2647,Stephanie Balaouras,Carbon Black,carbon black is a pretty successful company and its a great acquisition the space is definitely critically important and also hot very interested in the new security business unit,8/22/2019,Positive,Strategy,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2648,Josh Zelonis,Carbon Black,theres a lot of market confusion around the different offerings and cloudstrike has destroyed them in marketing carbon black has continued to embrace the traditional carbon black response product and its been impossible to track all the different versions of their releases the traditional product that they released in 2013 is still the one that they leverage in any kind of market evaluation theyve made acquisitions in the interim years since they came to market and they dont highlight how theyve integrated them they keep going back to what they think is their bread and butter which is a great tool but is a management nightmare for anybody in the enterprise,8/22/2019,Neutral,Strategy,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2649,Josh Zelonis,Carbon Black,lots of market confusion around carbon black,8/22/2019,Negative,Marketing Awareness,2019.3,FY20 Q3

2652,Peter Firstbrook,Carbon Black,carbon black  from a vision perspective they are late to market with a few features   load detection vulnerability detection  much of the work they are doing is catching up vs surpassing,8/22/2019,Negative,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2019.3,FY20 Q3
2653,Peter Firstbrook,Carbon Black,carbon black  vision side  not very far behind late to market with features missing is rogue device management and detection with you can solve with airwatch  who has agent installed  no vulnerabilitiy detection no hardening  predetection capabilities missing  configuration management and integration with identity is getting critical microsoft has crowdstrike has firmware protection and file integrity laundering add value to their offering that carbon black doesnt have,8/22/2019,Negative,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2019.3,FY20 Q3

2659,Dennis Smith,Pivotal,been saying for 5 years that vmwareare should bring pivotal back into the fold,8/22/2019,Positive,Strategy,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2660,Dennis Smith,Pivotal,does this concede that maybe it was a mistake to spin pivotal off in 2013 or is it a matter of the timing being right now with kubernetes and such bringing them back into the fold,8/22/2019,Neutral,Strategy,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2661,Dennis Smith,Pivotal,clearly the whole hybrid multicloud narrative is really key the importance and the underlying infrastructure i was preannounced on project pacific in my eyes i think its its a positive it gives you a narrative answer to the whole ibmred hat thing also which is a similar narrative coming at it a bit bit differently perhaps in all candidness im laughing because ive been saying for five years that you should buy pivotal back so its its good to hear that its finally coming down,8/22/2019,Neutral,Messaging,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2662,Dave Bartoletti,Pivotal,pivotal did the timing of this announcement have anything to do with pivotals financial performance,8/22/2019,Neutral,Strategy,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2663,John Rymer,Pivotal,vmwareare needs to be able to tell the story about why it will now be successful with pivotal when in the past the combination wasnt successful,8/22/2019,Advice,Messaging,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2664,John Rymer,Pivotal,you imply youll have an infrastructure sales motion ie current vmwareare and and a software developer platform sales motion ie current pivotal those 3000 pivotal people let them continue to do their thing,8/22/2019,Advice,Strategy,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2665,Jeffrey Hammond,Pivotal,in the context of not losing what developers love about pivotal in the acquisition developers say my top is java and javascript microservices so how do you help me deliver that more easily,8/22/2019,Advice,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2019.3,FY20 Q3
2666,John Rymer,Pivotal,vmwareare needs to be able to answer whats different now with combining pivotal and vmware again wall st will be looking for vmware to speak about applications credibly if you start out talking about apps and say the answer is kubernetes it says that you dont understand apps and you dont live in that world,8/22/2019,Advice,Messaging,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2667,Dave Bartoletti,Pivotal,said he is close to people at pivotal most were not around when it was part of vmwareare and there is hesitation at pivotal about this ie the acquisition,8/22/2019,Neutral,VMworld,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2668,John Rymer,Pivotal,pivotal pivotal was born in part because cloud foundry middleware assets vmwareare acquired needed to be separate  issues that called for sw assets to be called out separately to grow on its own  issues in the sales channel why now  what has changed  why will vmware be successful now,8/22/2019,Neutral,Strategy,2019.3,FY20 Q3

2670,Angelina Troy,Cloud (VCPP),im very interested to see what you are going to do around kubernetes one thing that comes to mind is ill bet there will be perceptions to overcome around vmwareare orchestrations that would be with other technologies that compete with your own,8/21/2019,Neutral,Messaging,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2671,Phil Dawson,Cloud Foundation,regarding project magna our lines of similarity are unbelievable  im currently writing on administration application and automation around composable programmable and intelligent infrastructure i think your storyline is not far off mine one thing youre missing in magna is self scale  you sort of got it with self escalate and locationbased sensitivity probably needs to be addedyoure doing a lot around management of cloud and hci as a foundation for cloud delivery but your customers still need more education  theres confusion and fud nutanix so you need to keep messaging to your strengthsyou didnt make a lot of progress on stoage  you still dont have files or objects  but your product releases focused on being container relevant  kubernetes relevant and day 2 operations its very interesting that vmwareare has closed the gap vs nutanix on gartner peer insights for example ,8/21/2019,Neutral,Strategy,2019.3,FY20 Q3

2673,William Fellows,Tanzu,stepping away from the technology piece buildrunmanage surely assists in the rotation of the vmwareare model to an application view alongside the infrastructure view this is the key challenge as pats pointed out a number of times front and center mainstage this is an important message,8/21/2019,Positive,Messaging,2019.3,FY20 Q3

2687,Tony Iams,Containers/PKS,how he explains kubernetes to clients i look at kubernetes as being the linux for the cloud native era you can argue about whether it is an os or not or at least the formal definition of an os but it has visibility over all the resources and it controls placement over the resources of that infrastructure containers are just os processes so it feels like an os across the cluster data center but like linux its just a kernel its just a bunch of libraries and code just like linux you need to get a supported distribution or service just like linux enabled a new set of development tools and practices youre seeing the same thing with kubernetes for things like microservices,8/19/2019,Neutral,Messaging,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2688,Tony Iams,Containers/PKS,how he explains kubernetes to clients its the platform on which modern cloud native workloads are going to be built you can get it from many sources just like linux thats what it means to be the industry standard its the baseline youre going to need it to participate in the new ecosystem of tools and development processes being built on it,8/19/2019,Neutral,Messaging,2019.3,FY20 Q3

2692,Tony Iams,Containers/PKS,you cant underestimate the importance of the network interface with kubernetes the network plays an absolutely critical role that will become more evident the more service mesh gets adopted not to mention ingress strong networking layer will just get more important critical to kubernetes need to emphasize that thats a key component here,8/19/2019,Neutral,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2019.3,FY20 Q3

2699,Tony Iams,SDDC (vSphere),related to project pacific the caution there is its good to be aligned with the community but when i hear the latest version of kubernetes i dont exactly think of stability so yes its good to be engaged with the community and at the sharp end of the spear but what you use in production is not the latest version its the n1 n2 or even n3 type distribution thats what the other players do like redhat or whatever theyll have something thats not necessarily bleeding edge but has been tested and is supported in production depends on who you are trying to resonate with even with the cloud native crowd you want to be careful its less good with the enterprise crowd,8/19/2019,Advice,Messaging,2019.3,FY20 Q3
2700,Tom Bittman,All Products,questioned our definition of hybrid and asked if were saying that hybrid is how things are run below the service line mike hulme specified that we think consistent infrastructure is one of the defining elements certainly of the compute storage and networking elements tom would say its a consistent interface that it looks and feels and behaves the same but that doesnt mean that the infrastructure has to be the same and that the operations below it have to be the same,8/16/2019,Negative,Messaging,2019.3,FY20 Q3

2805,Andrew Lerner,Networking,emerging area of networking where value can be created by vmwareare  everyone has data can drop it on a platform for actionable insights currently not a good application for this in networking largely driven by functional requirements vs operational benefits,7/31/2019,Advice,Strategy,2019.2,FY20 Q2
2806,Andrew Lerner,Networking,next way to differentiate on product level and shift marketing conversation is to focus on selfhealing actional insights components of networking  once running it is automated  none of networking guys do this well  vmwareare can do this and shift the conversation and market focus on operational aspects and benefits of managing networks  cisco will focus on functions  innovation needs to be on operational not functional,7/31/2019,Advice,Strategy,2019.2,FY20 Q2
2807,Andrew Lerner,SD-WAN,velocloud   analytics and day 2 operations should be improved upon to be more application centric do this to continue to differentiate ui is excellent but when you dive into it it is network centric it is about bandwidth and sites not as app centric as cloudgenix or meraki insights bring in proactive capacity planning ,7/31/2019,Neutral,Strategy,2019.2,FY20 Q2

2811,Dennis Smith,Containers/PKS,everyone is head long there run were having many messaging meetings etc the layer above it build i dont think the masses at vmwareare and pivotal understand what you have with bitnami and pivotal they can help you appeal to developers and take you above the fray of this shark tank of everyone trying to provide this kubernetes dialtone its much more than that handling the app developers and providing them services this is not just kubernetes this is really a platform that would allow me as a developer to transform my environment,7/31/2019,Advice,Strategy,2019.2,FY20 Q2
2812,Dennis Smith,Containers/PKS,there are a ton of competitors jumping in relatively large companies in the run piece almost an equal number running into the manage piece even though there are a lot of oneoff players too that build piece in many ways in my eyes is probably 5 layers you guys redhatibm aws azure and also google those are really the players here and frankly you and redhat and ibm are coming at this a little bit differently where youre saying we can provide those boxes and we can provide them anywhere as opposed to the other three buys,7/31/2019,Neutral,Competitive mentions/intel,2019.2,FY20 Q2
2813,Dennis Smith,Containers/PKS,he felt we need to be clear that we are not including the fullymanaged service aspects of cloud pks in tanzu kubernetes service and it is vital that we get to having a fullymanaged offering asap as that is where customers are going dont lose cloud pks or consider it fully covered by tanzu mission control,7/31/2019,Advice,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2019.2,FY20 Q2

2817,Andrew Lerner,Networking,customers see transformation as risk aversion as well  millenials are less averse to risk than gen x next big use will be kubernetes kubernetes 10 now going to 80 in production by 2023,7/31/2019,Neutral,Strategy,2019.2,FY20 Q2
2818,Dennis Smith,Tanzu,regarding tanzu mission control he said so this is the rancher killer if you will,7/31/2019,Positive,Competitive mentions/intel,2019.2,FY20 Q2
2819,Arun Chandrasekaran,Bitnami,very important for vmwareare get into the consciousness of devops and the developer community the build tools such as app marketplacesbitnami are important for vmware to position itself as a developerfriendly platform since you have low mindshare with devs also the bitnami templates are more supportive of pubic cloud environments and less so of private it that needs to be changed too,7/30/2019,Advice,Strategy,2019.2,FY20 Q2
2820,Arun Chandrasekaran,Tanzu,he would really like to see parity between tanzu kubernetes service onpremises and the saas service in the cloud formerly cloud pks  beta only he thinks thats very important from a customer standpoint and from a product standpoint there were inconsistencies with apis etc with cloud pks now vmwareare has an opportunity because you have a common set of open source across both environments,7/30/2019,Advice,Strategy,2019.2,FY20 Q2
2821,Arun Chandrasekaran,Tanzu,i like mission control this is a critical aspect give power back to the customers how workloads are running security issues etc,7/30/2019,Positive,Customer Related,2019.2,FY20 Q2

2824,Dave Bartoletti,Containers/PKS,many questions around the introduction to tanzu such as does pks go away what of the pivotal relationship i cant see how this is not directly competitive to what pivotal will continue to offer so thats something that pats going to need to work out with pivotal marketing its not the first time this has happened vmwareare comes back in and decides well we let this part go to one of our family members one of our dell family members and now we dont want that anymore,7/29/2019,Negative,Partnerships/Dell,2019.2,FY20 Q2
2825,Dave Bartoletti,Containers/PKS,we could hear the analysts texting each other as weve been talking back channel here this is the third or fourth time in 10 years that vmwareare has decided to go back after apps and the biggest challenge every time is you go back after apps you talk a lot about apps and then the rest of the pitch is all about management control planes but as jeffrey hammond is always saying what brings developers to an app platform is the developer experience if they continue to come to these platforms through a developer experience created by pivotal or redhat or anthos then that guides who they look to to build them a control plane,7/29/2019,Negative,Messaging,2019.2,FY20 Q2
2826,Dave Bartoletti,Containers/PKS,agreed that as enterprises build more containerized applications there will be more demand over time coming up from traditional io teams that want to create this on a vsphere environment so theres another route that is not just through the developer,7/29/2019,Positive,Customer Related,2019.2,FY20 Q2
2827,Dave Bartoletti,Containers/PKS,3 to 4 years ago when people started building in containers vmwareare added container management into the platform integrated containers 45 years before that vmware had to get the admins to realize that they should be the network administrators vmworld is all about teaching them to operate networks the challenge is building that demand in the admins you better build this your developers are going to want it,7/29/2019,Advice,Marketing Awareness,2019.2,FY20 Q2
2828,Chris Gardner,Containers/PKS,at the cisco event where they announced devnet the admins were walking out of the room as they were announcing it saying i dont see the value to me he thinks we may have a similar situation with vm admins and containers he believes they do have to go this route but fears we may have a similar reception with olympus,7/29/2019,Negative,Customer Related,2019.2,FY20 Q2
2829,Dave Bartoletti,Containers/PKS,if vmwareare presents this as something for developers you better have a developer experience and thats not what its for this is for admins and platform operators who are building this for their developers when they want it thats the tension in the market right now futurethinking devops teams dont pick platforms the same way anymore where developers pick their own things and they build apps and then they throw it to it and it fits it into the infrastructure they pick those platforms together i think more often,7/29/2019,Neutral,Customer Related,2019.2,FY20 Q2

2869,Chris Gardner,Management (vRealize),center of excellences have previously gotten a bad rep  now they might not called be a center but more of an automation team the center of excellence has changed and previously didnt have a lot of accountability  we see one group getting more responsibility and hard deliverables  it does look like these groups are going on top of infrastructure and are delivering and maintaining  there is not a handoff the model might be more productive than in the past,7/24/2019,Advice,Adoption,2019.2,FY20 Q2
2870,Chris Gardner,Management (vRealize),forrester believes you would need multiple centers in an organization not a single center  but how that lives out is still being determined  we dont see alignment for products yet its more of a use case there has to be alignment and interaction between groups forrester sees the intersection as scale  the tension is from legacy io systems  the key is automation of the stack forrester is seeing people exploring models with devops tool chains,7/24/2019,Neutral,Adoption,2019.2,FY20 Q2

2896,Mary Johnston Turner,CloudHealth,she saw a graphic overview of olympus including cloud health she said she had not seen cloudhealth as part of the cloud native portfolio but has seen it as a basic multicloud governance and cloud management tool very interested to see it as part of olympus she said she is doing a whitepaper for the vrealize and cloud health team in the first draft she had written about future requirements including container management and it was taken out paul dul pointed out that cloud health is not cloud nativespecific but is applicable to cloud native she said that it hasnt been positioned this way and we may have an opportunity here to get our companywide ducks in a row,7/23/2019,Advice,Messaging,2019.2,FY20 Q2
2897,Mary Johnston Turner,Containers/PKS,she thinks pks naming might be confusing to people essential pks doesnt sound like open portable kubernetes still sounds like even when you unpack it most would assume its still heavily aligned with pivotal many excited about kubernetes due to notion of portability and dont understand that a kubernetes platform involves choices beyond the scheduling platform many orgs looking for that clean reliance on kubernetes that gives the promise of workload portability she wonders for vmwareare if we should still be positioning around pks or talking about a general kubernetes service this comment was made without any mention of upcoming new branding for containers,7/23/2019,Advice,Messaging,2019.2,FY20 Q2
2898,Mary Johnston Turner,Containers/PKS,she recently published on container priorities trying to tease out how general cloud management and emerging devops container management priorities were or were not converging interesting in light of olympus there was a question that said so what are your top container management priorities  for devops organizations the 2 priority was managing the cost and lifecycle of the container infrastructure which clearly includes what cloudhealth does for those responsible for managing the production of a containerized application their 1st choice was to increase use of automation but 2 was managing the cost of lifecycle container infrastructure she thinks we are onto something by including cloud health in the conversation that this is a differentiator cost and governance pieces are not usually as closely integrated into the container  kubernetes stack she is ore likely to see solutions like wavefront and service mesh the lifecycle  stuff she believes theres a real opportunity to differentiate with cloud health but the message would be strengthened if all of vmwareare talked about it,7/23/2019,Advice,Messaging,2019.2,FY20 Q2

3082,Mike Dorosh,All Products,according to mike you can roll your own hybrid cloud build hybrid  multicloud from bucket or my primary hyperscaler is x and im using their preferred provider another term that daryl plummer and david mitchell smith coined is distributed cloud this refers to the idea of getting public cloud services anywhere and an intentional consistency of platform eg awsvmc on awsoutposts an issue that mike said that vmwareare is forcing all of the major cloud players have hybrid cloud and integrated stack so we can now deploy public cloud services anywhere and it acknowledges all cloud,6/10/2019,Neutral,Messaging,2019.2,FY20 Q2

3234,Al Gillen,Containers/PKS,regarding the bitnami acquisition announcementi very much think a catalogue that is multi platform for apps is pretty attractive but would question how much support youll get from microsoft or google do you expect strong buyin from them to get their app partners to use this ,5/21/2019,Positive,Strategy,2019.2,FY20 Q2

3274,Chris Drake,VMC on AWS,with the new microsoft partnership do you envisage similar technical and commercial things that need to be addressed my understanding is that the microsoft partnership is not to replicate the vmc on aws solution but the idea is to create a common operational environment and to support a similar range of use cases so presumably will there be a set of technical and commercial issues that need to be addressed,5/15/2019,Neutral,Partnerships/Dell,2019.2,FY20 Q2
3275,Mark Nicolett,Security (AppDefense),current thinking by the covering analysts but this is not a formal commitment is that vmwareare will not be included in the full evaluation along with the other new entrants that are oriented to network security for cloud workloads while other entrants may receive full evaluations and writeups in the mq and critical capabilities research notes particularly the network security for cloud workloads cc use case current thinking is that vmware will just receive a very brief mention in the vendors to watch section of the mq and no mention in the critical capabilities research note note this is re vmware attempting to be excluded from the network firewalls mq which we succeeded in doing,5/14/2019,Advice,Strategy,2019.2,FY20 Q2

3277,Arun Chandrasekaran,Containers/PKS,if just cloud native workloads google  rancher poised for success but always telling google you cant assume the whole world will move to containers google believes that but customers dont customers see their container and cloud strategies as 2 different things no need to containerize all apps,5/14/2019,Positive,Strategy,2019.2,FY20 Q2
3278,Arun Chandrasekaran,Containers/PKS,ibm is trying to bring their control plane to manage clusters ibm has a lot of challenges in my opinion today they are starting a little late and i dont know how much credibility ibm has as a multicloud orchestration play given their own cloud to prioritize and sell whereas rancher and vmwareare have a cmp portfolio although you have a little bit of a cloud to sell because you have vmc on aws you are more of a software company ibm is much more complex i keep telling ibm you cant be an ops dealer and an ops supplier they have to decide what they want to be,5/14/2019,Neutral,Competitive mentions/intel,2019.2,FY20 Q2

3280,Caroline Chappell,Containers/PKS,11 with p fazzone at kubecon emea caroline asked for the meeting to understand the bitnami acquisition in light of vmwareares container strategy but some questions show a lack of knowledge about containers kubernetes and vms ie if you are a developer would you actually choose to develop for a vm environment as opposed to a kubernetes environment thats a false dichotomyother questions   if youre saying that pks is being tightly embedded and provides a bioswide cloudwide operating system this is a lovely image but eventually does kubernetes win and vms go away   if customers have got absolutely no cloud knowledge whatsoever what are they doing with open source because they cant make use of it they will have a lot of culture change to manage and many fundamental odds against them,5/14/2019,Negative,Adoption,2019.2,FY20 Q2

3292,Arun Chandrasekaran,Containers/PKS,client advice pks vs other solutions depends on use cases if looking for a kubernetes solution asks whether looking for an app paas platform or an enterprisegrade operational kubernetes solution if so openshift vs cloudfoundrypas but if just kubernetes dial tone require operational things to run kubernetes in production and deploying stateful apps and require a storage to support it if the focus is on operational tooling and production readiness of operational tooling the discussion moves into red hat vs pks or in some cases a ranchertype discussion dont see much apache mesosphere docker,5/10/2019,Neutral,Customer Related,2019.2,FY20 Q2
3293,Arun Chandrasekaran,Containers/PKS,he likes ranchers multicluster management control plane has used the tool and seen a demo seems rancher ahead of ibm others moving in the same direction this is a very common theme in briefings with our other competitors they recognize that an aspirational goals for kubernetes container customers is app portability all hoped containers would accomplish reality is kubernetes is becoming like a dial tone available from all distros across all clouds vendors building the control plane so you can do singlepaneofglass management you can do policy management,5/10/2019,Neutral,Competitive mentions/intel,2019.2,FY20 Q2

3295,Arun Chandrasekaran,Containers/PKS,problem with kubernetes multicluster management the control plane is dependent on the underlying kubernetes parameters ie to maintain things like state for example have to maintain a consistent state across multiple clusters dependent on stateful sets within kubernetes some of the underlying parameters in kubernetes are a little immature many customers feel its not where it should be stateful sets kubernetes community probably hopefully working on it underlying apis are different across different cloud environments so you either need either operators to manage it or you need to have service brokers to manage it,5/10/2019,Neutral,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2019.2,FY20 Q2

3361,Sanjit Ganguli,Tanzu Observability,enterprise it is an opportunity there is some risk is being safe  other vendors are not playing as safe  there is work to be done to satisfy workflows and demo when dimitri persona is not in the room you have the benefit of a parent company with deep pockets to get to the next level and enterprise market,5/2/2019,Advice,Strategy,2019.2,FY20 Q2
3362,Nick McQuire,Workspace ONE,from my conversations with microsoft i dont yet feel that they fully appreciate the benefit of being on the endpoint in the sense that since you can be an agent on the device and that is obviously the model that they have up until now been wanting to promote i felt that theyre also quite comfortable as theyve done with jamf and blackberry as in the previous time with the office management apis as well is that theres kind of a hedge going on,5/2/2019,Positive,Strategy,2019.2,FY20 Q2
3363,Nick McQuire,Workspace ONE,what i would expect will happen around the intune model is particularly the vmwarearemicrosoft model where there will be a point of impression made around the fact that actually intune as a backend cloud servicesis the conditional access authority thats absolutely fine its also being clear to the market because i think part of the challenge with conditional access is it oftentimes is confusing because it requires a kind of a mix of different technologies and vendor solutions as well so the contest is elegant the architecture is complicated and so when you start to educate on the combined product when you get it to market it would have to be very clear how simplistic the actual deployment of the service is and how hand in glove you are with the microsoft back end service,5/2/2019,Positive,Strategy,2019.2,FY20 Q2
3364,Nick McQuire,Workspace ONE,when you think about a conditional access scenario flow and your position as being on the endpoint and what you can do there as part of kind of device compliance and device trust into a conditional access framework for me coming back to my point on microsoft i feel that there was a focus for them to provide intune as being the agent of authority on the endpoint but then with blackberry and jamf and others there theyre also quite happy to have a backend service model with an intune license kind of lit up but also have vmwareare and others as the kind of the agent of authority on the actual endpoint for me it feels like they dont quite understand how important getting on the endpoint is and is increasingly going to be down the road ,5/2/2019,Positive,Strategy,2019.2,FY20 Q2
3365,Nick McQuire,Workspace ONE,for me it underlays this whole switzerland neutrality service platform kind of service aggregation role that you play entirely across vmwareare i think thats the important thing when you start to position this with customers ,5/2/2019,Positive,Strategy,2019.2,FY20 Q2
3366,Nick McQuire,Workspace ONE,sometimes the language of confusion that exists out there around conditional access is that vendors are badging themselves up as complete conditional access plays and theyre not because it requires multiple needs and so how youre going to bring together this capability and simplify it for customers is going to be really important,5/2/2019,Positive,Strategy,2019.2,FY20 Q2

3371,Dave Bartoletti,Containers/PKS,weve asked in our infrastructure survey how do developers want to consume containers youve approached this 3 different ways in the public cloud or the private cloud its 13 and 13 and 13 still we dont see any one dominant choice because i think theres lots of experimentation going on the net is you need a portfolio like vmwareares you need both selection points to succeed we sort of wanted people to get their acts together and have one approach to this and i dont think you can,5/1/2019,Positive,Strategy,2019.2,FY20 Q2
3372,Dave Bartoletti,Containers/PKS,regarding vsphere stretch cluster support in pks 14 which fills in some of the holes in kubernetes multi cluster management its probably the most vexing question we still get trying to tease out someones challenges with their kubernetes platform vs their challenges with the immaturity of some of the components of kubernetes themselves thats other vendors fud out there saying sure if you want to manage just one or two clusters these tools are all great but we help you manage clusters all over the world,5/1/2019,Neutral,Customer Related,2019.2,FY20 Q2
3373,Dave Bartoletti,Containers/PKS,i dont think anthos is very far ahead of their skiis if you look at it as on prem managed they already had gke on prem they just rebranded gke on prem but its a rebranding that has other things in it not quite sure what those other things were it was a lot of marketing they have a long road ahead of them like everyone else does to put something on prem they have minimal hardware relationships private cloud that gives you a public cloud experience is hard to do that doesnt cost a fortune,5/1/2019,Neutral,Competitive mentions/intel,2019.2,FY20 Q2
3374,Dave Bartoletti,Containers/PKS,they are being very google they are saying its only software the first question will be does it run on my 16 solutions from vmwareare that i already have and tested against all these different collections of vmware services i think it was very google that when you start talking about the challenges of onprem for people that want a cloud experience they dont want to be involved with that,5/1/2019,Positive,Competitive mentions/intel,2019.2,FY20 Q2
3375,Dave Bartoletti,Containers/PKS,its such a great time to be vmwareare youre really at the heart of all this data center stuff you can handle the push back azure stack is still running right into that incredibly expensive wall i dont think anthos on prem will be any less money if youre building something that really works and probably the fastest path to both of those is to build it on a vmware infrastructure youve already got,5/1/2019,Positive,Competitive mentions/intel,2019.2,FY20 Q2

3502,Dave Bartoletti,VMC on Dell EMC,for clouds and platforms you run on prem this is the future this aligns with googles version which is one level up the stack its googles development platform on private cloud youll have a google option as well youll have a google version that comes with gke on prem preinstalled youll have an aws outpost version what ties them all together is that theres this core virtualization layer that just works and you dont really manage it that deeply anymore,4/11/2019,Positive,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2019.1,FY20 Q1
3503,Dave Bartoletti,VMC on Dell EMC,there are several reasons people are still building private clouds one of them is a concern about security today its not that they dont believe the public cloud is more secure than the data center they believe that it just might take them a year to get approval to move it they dont want to wait until they get approval to move theres this attitude that public cloud is just not safe for your workloads well yes it is but it just might take you two years to get there,4/11/2019,Neutral,Adoption,2019.1,FY20 Q1

3510,Rick Villars,VMC on Dell EMC,we get the feeling that microsoft is getting fed up with its oem partnerships right now and they may do something more like outposts like they did on the tablet side you might hear about that sometime theyve got their event coming up in a month so well watch azure stack has not been a rip roaring success various reasons but one of them is the partnering has not had a lot of commitment in working out the details they have not been as forthcoming as you have been here,4/11/2019,Neutral,Competitive mentions/intel,2019.1,FY20 Q1
3511,Rick Villars,VMC on Dell EMC,you are resetting the expectations about how people will acquire the infrastructure in their data center its not technology as much as it is the delivery model and how youre integrating the service and support together  dont forego and ignore those new use cases and the ability to aquire those use cases it wouldnt be right to say this is only for that or you could miss out,4/11/2019,Advice,Marketing Awareness,2019.1,FY20 Q1

3833,Frank Dickson,Networking,in security words have meanings but words dont have shared meanings i am a little bit sensitive to your use of the word firewall the problem that i have with firewall even though you are using it correctly is that the industry starts associating meanings with that term that you may not be intending to associate the whole world of internal firewall ngfw we have all these firewall terms i just worry that you are gonna lose a little bit control of your message because each person who receives the message is going to interpret it from their own context,1/28/2019,Advice,Messaging,2018.4,FY19 Q4
3834,Nat Smith,Networking,even with vmwareare being as large and wellknown as you are when you start to talk about things in a completely different way it will help draw parallels and references to things that are already known even though it isnt anything like a perimeterbased firewall i encourage you to look at vendors in the valley who are doing network traffic analysis it seems like you would seek to apply their method but from a different vantage point,1/28/2019,Advice,Strategy,2018.4,FY19 Q4

4211,Stephen Elliot,Management (vRealize),good progress on the saas you hit a lot of the key personas and the issues they have internally helps work through political orientation especially early in the dev cycle it reduces political inertia and is a good story for everyone better ways to develop to a multicloud environment there is so much noise on the dev side highlight and get above the chat of other dev tools put the vision out early and use vmwareare brand credibility,7/16/2018,Advice,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2018.2,FY19 Q2
4212,Stephen Elliot,Management (vRealize),developers want to feel like they are choosing their tools and they can care less about the underlining infrastructure from a developer point of view explain why they should use tango and why it is a better way recommend highlighting why vmwareare is better and makes their job easier showcase how to make it successful look at 3 metrics from beta users or highlight how the developer job got easier might be a good option to elevate the story this is timely and its saas,7/16/2018,Advice,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2018.2,FY19 Q2
4213,Mark Fabbi,Networking,definitely pleased to see what youve been doing on the sales compensation side seems like youve been doing a lot of work the only other lever you have there is making velo a necessary component as well so getting additional quota relief helps making it mandatory whether it is 10 or 20 that puts some heightened awareness because if it is just quota retirement they can coast make it mandatory that they close some business,7/16/2018,Positive,Strategy,2018.2,FY19 Q2

4309,Andrew Lerner,Networking,vmwareares networking business does have distinct challenges including limited influence with traditional networking buyer centers nsx pricing is quite high gartner clients routinely mention that the pricing affiliated with nsx is very difficult to justify internally the expertise of vmwares channel around networking is not as deep in terms of networking expertise compared to several networking competitors as a result traction for nsx has been limited to less than 20 of the customers that could benefit from it gartner estimate a more tactical and situational challenge  but still tedious  is that vmware currently has two nsx platforms including nsx for vsphere and nsxt multiple environments,3/28/2018,Negative,Pricing,2018.1,FY19 Q1
4310,Andrew Lerner,Networking,there are several things that vmwareare must do well to maintain its momentum in networking first integration and execution of the velocloud sdwan capability is key this includes delicately managing veloclouds hardware portfolio  hardware is not vmwares strength  while also avoiding overcharging for veloclouds capability this must occur simultaneously with vmware maturing its networking channel and helping customers manage the transition to nsxt,3/28/2018,Advice,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2018.1,FY19 Q1

4536,Naresh Singh,Networking,delays in delivery on hybrid cloud networking native cloud and multihypervisorvmwareare has been on more than one occasion too slow with executing upon its product roadmap for example during vmworld 2015 it made public plans to provide integration with aws demonstrating a working case of running nsx in an aws public cloud environment while it has now announced offerings such as vcf vcf and crosscloud architecture its integrated offering with aws has yet to see general availability which is expected only in the third quarter of 2017 such delays in time to market can be costly in a dynamic environment such as cloud servicessssssss,8/1/2017,Negative,Adoption,2017.3,FY18 Q3
4537,Naresh Singh,Networking,extension of virtual it infrastructure vmwareare nsx is an overlay network fabric solution that is a logical upgrade path for the vsphere installed base as it offers additional value to vmwares virtual and cloud platform by enabling faster network provisioning time and an effective network service orchestration platform nsx does not require a large investment or network hardware refresh to try out as it is available in bundles and can be implemented in phases,8/1/2017,Positive,Adoption,2017.3,FY18 Q3
4538,Naresh Singh,Networking,a compelling data center network vision vmwareares vision for an increasingly virtualized network aligns well with the growing need to abstract the network into a service component that can be rapidly and flexibly provisioned to meet the agility requirements of enterprises its network offering is also a critical component of its softwaredefined data center sddc roadmap which it has been actively promoting among the strategic and matured segments of its customer base,8/1/2017,Positive,Adoption,2017.3,FY18 Q3
4539,Naresh Singh,Networking,overlay network fabric leadership the nsx solution from vmwareare has experienced steady growth and it has the most paying customers in terms of overlay network offerings in the market today according to vmware nsx license bookings increased 50 year over year in 1q17 and it now has more than 2600 customers with more than 1000 in production networks although adoption of overlay fabrics in general has been slow with less than 2000 production deployments through mid2017 in total there has been an increase in demand for network automation and orchestration that such overlay solutions address network virtualization virtual security and virtual network service gateways are among the most popular use cases of nsx with microsegmentationbased network security being used in nearly half of all implementations thus far,8/1/2017,Positive,Customer Related,2017.3,FY18 Q3

4541,Naresh Singh,Networking,a lack of strong relationships with the networking buying center vmwareare has traditionally harbored a virtual network overlay view that is independent of the physical underlay network while the compulsion to interconnect with data center physical endpoints has driven it to partner with networking hardware providers vmware has lacked the ability to use these integrations and partnerships as a bridge to the networking team in addition the resonant feedback from our client inquiries has been that vmware has done little so far to reach out to the traditional networking teams that continue to view vmware as an outsider in the networking space this is a serious issue that vmware must address if it wants to expand and grab a bigger piece of the data center network pie also it is imperative that vmware works with the networking team to ensure a less disruptive process as it tries to scale its solution across its existing network installed base,8/1/2017,Negative,Partner readiness,2017.3,FY18 Q3
4542,Naresh Singh,Networking,delays in delivery on hybrid cloud networking native cloud and multihypervisor multihypervisor support is a long standing gap that has been exploited by multiple competitors it is also a major source of the negative perception of nsx being a closed network solution nsx multihypervisor which is based on technology vmwareare acquired from nicira has served customers that have multiple hypervisors vmware however has not adequately invested in it lacking on efforts to expand support to key hypervisors like microsoft hyperv and preferring to focus more on the nsx for vsphere platform,8/1/2017,Negative,Features or products (included/missing/recommended),2017.3,FY18 Q3
4543,Naresh Singh,Networking,expensive offering pricing has often been a point of contention with customers and prospects when it comes to vmwareare the combination of hypervisor licenses and the ongoing investment required for the underlay physical network makes it difficult for several customers to justify the overall high costs of implementing nsx the relatively high price of nsx has been a continuation of vmwares tendency to overprice new product offerings it further fuels the perception of vmware trying to obtain a premium from its existing customer base and has led to some resistance in nsx adoption although vmware has recently made changes to reduce the barriers of entry by introducing multiple editions starting at lower pricing many large customers will most likely still have concerns regarding vmware pricing vmware does provide rich valueadds with its network offerings and also through integration with partners such as big switch networks and arista networks but at the same time vmware needs to realize that adopting a more accessible approach to its solutions could be more rewarding in the long term in regards to its competitors,8/1/2017,Negative,Pricing,2017.3,FY18 Q3
4544,Naresh Singh,Networking,dominant x86 server virtualization installed base and credibility as a strategic data center vendor vmwareare remains the largest vendor by revenue in the x86 server virtualization infrastructure market it has the largest installed base of virtual machines significantly higher than its competitors such as microsoft with the average rate of virtualization of x86 server os instances in onpremises environments reaching 75 in 2015 vmware is a major influencer in the overall data center infrastructure scene this mind share  along with the fact that vsphere embeds a virtual ethernet switch  easily gives a solid platform for vmware to push for strong growth and continued expansion in the data center network market specifically in the area of network virtualization,8/1/2017,Positive,Strategy,2017.3,FY18 Q3
